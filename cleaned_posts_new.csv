1129572444152825,"Hi. Today’s my 21st birthday and I’m feeling really upset. I don’t really have any friends at school nor at home. My family’s more or less all I’ve got. My Mom and Dad went out of their way to make a really huge Paddle Tennis event with about 30 of my Dad’s friends today. (The vast majority being people whom I’ve never met before.) They’re all playing / boozing in my backyard. I think my Dad forgot that it was my birthday today. The alternative is that he does know, he would just rather drink and play paddle? I don’t plan on going outside and exposing myself to a bunch of total strangers. (Especially given the fact that I’m immunocompromised.) If I voiced any reasonable concern over a gathering of about 30 people during a pandemic, then I’d be told to “leave if I had a problem”. I’m so hurt by this. I’ve been randomly bursting into tears throughout the day when no one’s around me. So yea, here’s my depressing secret about how my parents are having a huge party on my 21st without me.",2021-03-08 21:33:14,1615260794,0,0,0

Also, the Thinker comment section is unironically now a place where people discuss politics, and they should know by now that section 230 of the CDA protects them from legal action for libelious/otherwise illegal speech, so obviously the reason they have this policy in place is not to shield them from liability, but to silence those who don't agree with them.

 LOL all the dense motherfuckers in the comments making false comparisons. Sure, choosing to fuck raw is the same thing as accidentally falling or getting injured. Mhm. Ok, it’s the same thing as becoming addicted to smoking. Yea for
sure. Get better comparisons. OP is correct in saying that the vast majority of people who get abortions are people who *chose* not to use contraceptives, and to live with the consequences.

It is so so easy to put on a condom, and if you somehow think that it’s the same thing as saying “it is so so easy to not have accidental injury/not smoke/etc” then you are making a stupid argument.

Abortion is lit, abortion is healthcare, fuck them kids. BUT your guys’ argument sucks dick. Give me more irrelevant points about how 1% of abortions are health related, incest, rape, etc etc. Yeah Yeah.",2021-03-17 03:24:53,1615969493,0,2,0

Yet she can get excited about it cause “she’s famous now”.

Fat men suffer so much social pain because of weight and you'd be a gaslighting fool to insist otherwise. But, that doesn't mean that fat women have it any better. Consider how exclusively highlighting fat female bodies as sex objects/sex appeal in media might be another function of misogyny.

If it were men and women equally, I'd accept it as body positivity, but to me most of the media campaigns seem more like attempts to further capitalize on women as sex objects. Body positivity should mean that everyone's bodies are beautiful and that needs to be evident in the images and messages that are spread with body positivity at the fore.

I understand your point and am often frustrated with the pervasive antisemitism that exists in a lot of leftist circles. I still think that neocolonial theory is useful for understanding what is happening in Israel/Palestine right now. While Jewish people are indigenous to Israel, many to most of the US conservatives that support Israel are not Jewish (and some of them are white supremacists). The fact is that a lot of American and European interests in the Middle East depend on the state of Israel existing in it's current form. So no, zionists and Israeli jews are not colonists, but the billions and billions of dollars the US has given to Israel in military aid over the years is absolutely a form of colonial power.",2021-05-21 16:36:03,1621632963,0,0,0

This is ridiculous. If you were under the influence and someone came and legitimately choked or stabbed you, then is the cause of death the alcohol in your body? No. There is no evidence that fentanyl killed him. This is only from people who are trying to make excuses to continue the oppression of blacks at the hands of police. To put it plainly, George Floyd was alive, breathing, walking, and talking before he had a knee to his neck. To claim otherwise is to support the idea that the “fentanyl he had in his body” (which has been disputed) somehow magically killed him in the VERY INSTANT that he had a knee to his neck.

feel-bad topics happen to be those under consideration when someone is outraged and angry. Outrage is a psychologically toxic thing which feels good and which can often hurt others when indulged. We should do everything we can to denormalize it because it hurts everyone involved! Teaching children that outrage is not only ok but good will cause them to seek it out, and outrage is an insidious thing which legitimizes itself under the guise of moral superiority and can become all-consuming. I think that the current American far right and far left are both founded on outrage, and that's very worrying to me.

Idk why people don’t understand that eating issues are never the root of the problem. Like if someone is eating too much and gaining weight, it’s never gonna help to be like hey stop eating so much. People get so triggered by others overeating and think fat people just need a good lecture to bring them to their senses it’s so weird. The conversation with that persons roommate should not mention the eating at all and just be about their mental health, which is clearly the issue here.",2021-06-04 23:47:01,1622868421,0,0,0

The assigned readings are like 20 pages long and pretty unnecessary. The course material is 75% overlap with the other classes in the fundamentals sequence, and 25% niche details that no one will remember or use. Jason will put like 10-15 graphs or figures up on a single slide to make a point that relates to one of them, max. He answers questions in the most roundabout way possible with complicated language - it really seems like he just likes hearing himself talk and appearing super smart. It's a completely ineffective style of teaching. Honestly the lectures by Dave and Sliman almost made it worse because they just made me yearn for better times in better courses.

1235744053535663,"Dave Filoni bothers me. I’m fine with talentless hacks having fun in a selfindulgent nerdfest. What really bothers me is the amount of importance the Star Wars fandom puts on such an obviously untalented creator. People pretend he is some sort of paragon of creativity and intellectual originality. No. Wake up. He is not doing anything more significant than those weirdos on Tumblr obsessed with Supernatural who create OCs and self-inserts in their bizarro fanfictions.

When you are a member of the organization that created the Disney Trilogy and eradicated 40 years of Legends content, when that organization is currently celebrating the Bad Batch, a show that purports to engage the entire fandom while making 10 mediocre episodes and a finale that is obvious Sequel apologia, you have an obligation to create Star Wars content that is meaningful and relevant. Lucasfilm not only is an Ivory Tower and a wretched hive of scum and villainy; it celebrates being one. There is a reason their projects make so much money yet very little relevance amongst the fanbase.

You want to do something creative? While I was reading Heir to the Empire I met Jorus C’baoth, a character that had incredible depth, insightful commentary on the state of the Galaxy, and thoughtful creativity. Ahsoka falls far short of that standard. Start there. Instead of bashing Legends for being convoluted or inane, why don’t you realize that you need some actual effort and thought from real fans, people who understand Star Wars with more breadth and nuance?

You want to do something remarkable? Why not start some conversations about how Ahsoka has the most plot armor out of any Star Wars character, instead of indulging yourselves in weird fangirling for a deluded fanboy’s OC? You bash Legends for power scaling, and you think Rebels is oh-so-profound because of a family dynamic and the Bendu, but the average quality of rumination on the Force, world-building, and care taken for lore consistency is far lower than that in Legends, in both the canon novels and shows. Canon doesn’t exist in an abstraction. Canon is rigid and fits neatly into boxes, where things happen or they don’t. Retconning the Kanan comic in the Bad Batch season opener is not helpful.

So I guess the real reason Dave Filoni bothers me so much is that he’s emblematic whole the self-indulgent, self-congratulating Lucasfilm culture that is completely unaware of its incompetence and so detached from its fanbase. It has been given an IP and budget that many artists and fans can only dream of having. There are so many talented creators I have met at DragonCon that would probably look at his creations and see the same thing we see when we look at the last season of Game of Thrones -- an immense waste of talent and money.

When I speak to Star Wars fans, I often talk about the kind of love for the franchise that is possible only because you are surrounded by passionate individuals and we will give each other the support to create cool stuff -- fan games, art, fan films, song remixes, special edition edits, etc etc. A few months ago, an elderly, tired-looking woman raised her hand and asked me why I was talking about fans having fun and creating and reading Legends content instead of simply consuming content. I told her that the attention to detail in Legends is top-notch, but that’s just a given -- it’s a baseline on which we build more multifaceted, impactful interactions with Star Wars. I told her it’s not a waste of time, because think about it: if we want to retcon the Disney trilogy, do we want the aftermath to be designed by a man who invented literal space portals to save his OC, or do you want someone who did write fanfiction but also memorized the names of the Trade Federation’s leadership? I cannot say the same thing about Lucasfilm; they do in fact waste ridiculous amounts of time and resources doing crap like the Bad Batch and meaningless comic arcs that don’t involve respect for the canon and the characters. I told the lady that if you want to focus solely on making money, you should continue to produce, Mrs. Kennedy.

People criticize the community for the amounts of toxicity, anti-Disney sentiment, and general distaste for Lucasfilm. But I’ve seen a surprising number of people use those viewpoints as opportunities to learn more about the problems with Star Wars so they can create their own Star Wars content or do more impactful stuff in the film/print industry, and the Reddit comments in r/SaltierThanCrait back me up. There is a reason Star Wars fans become writers, directors, and politicians; and it is not just because of pedigree and toxicity.

I am not saying Star Wars fans are altruistic world-changers. They are toxic, often bigoted people who seek to tear others down and bullshit about retcons while comfortably residing in their moms’ basements. But at least they have those retcons. At least they want to make some sort of impact, and at least they pretend to care about Star Wars while pursuing their own successes. When have filmmakers ever changed Star Wars (outside of George Lucas) by purely focusing on making money? For all the ridiculous bullshit Dave Filoni has come up with, why is Luuke still less cringe inducing than the Purgill? How many respectful approaches to canon do we ever see coming out of Lucasfilm? This place has talent and resources. Why are they wasting them on Cobb Vanth when they can use that time to do much more meaningful things? Why is Dave Filoni ignoring his social responsibility?",2021-08-26 07:06:38,1629979598,1,2,0

 @the commenter, they aren’t wrong though. It’s an amazing purpose but I’m not sure if there’s anything in place to stop a rapist from fabricating some story out of retaliation. They clearly aren’t morally above anything. While awareness should obviously be spread, and victims shouldn’t have to verify their assault, I do worry about it ending up akin to the Salem witch trials etc, where anyone can accuse anyone and they’re judged as guilty automatically.

Additionally, if you go back and unfollow your peers on the grounds that “their posts annoy you,” I must say that I have been unfollowed before despite not having posted anything in months!! So!!!

1239224639854271,"I guess I'll add to the chorus of people worried that an anonymous reporting service could do harm to innocent people. The purpose and intent of the page is great! People who do harm should be held accountable, but saying that anyone who has an allegation against them deserves to have their name posted on social media in a way that will never go away without any investigation is just denying facts.

In the studies I'm citing, false accusations are considered those that are provably false, as in they are known not to happen. Baseless is considered cases where evidence cannot be found so it is impossible to determine.

A multi-site study of eight U.S. communities including 2,059 cases of sexual assault found a 7.1 percent rate of false reports (Lonsway, Archambault, & Lisak, 2009).

A study of 136 sexual assault cases in Boston from 1998-2007 found a 5.9 percent rate of false reports (Lisak et al., 2010).

Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, researchers studied 812 reports of sexual assault from 2000-2003 and found a 2.1 percent rate of false reports (Heenan & Murray 2006)

Reports also show that false reporting is higher in college communities and to services that aren't formal legal services (title ix). I am sure they are even higher on sites that offer no accountability for falsely accusing others.

I am not saying that we shouldn't believe victims, we should, but we shouldn't jump to actions that could destroy someone's life when there is a significant chance that someone could make up such a horrible event to damage someone they hate. It's horrible that that even happens, but it does. I wish it didn't, but every piece of evidence suggests that it does.",2021-08-31 13:38:52,1630435132,0,0,0

1239503899826345,"This talk about “due process” is completely misplaced. In a law court or a court that mimics a law court (like a Title IX court), no one can be convicted unless it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt, usually with forensic rather than merely circumstantial evidence, that they are guilty. This means that people who we all know have committed crimes often go free because there is little or no admissible evidence to convict them. This is as it should be.

However, people do not, have never, and rationally speaking should not refrain from forming opinions about other people (or expressing these opinions) until these people have been convicted of crimes in a court of law. That would be absurd (and potentially dangerous!), and it’s not how we operate. If multiple people told you that someone you know had smashed a window at a party last weekend, you wouldn’t think “I will not believe anything one way or another unless the party’s host presses charges and the alleged perpetrator is convicted”—of course not! You’d probably think “well, it’s technically possible that this could be a weird fabricated rumor, but it seems pretty likely that the person probably did it.”

Of course we should not immediately believe everything that we hear about other people, and we should always be open to changing our minds if new evidence comes out, but asking people follow legal rules of due process in their own minds is totally inappropriate and absurd.

1242015759575159,"Vaush has a very serious ego problem. He never admits with even a hint of humility that he was initially wrong about the definition of Black Nationalism—he skips right to indignation at the very idea that somebody might not realize that he's since changed his position. So he technically acknowledges the fact that he fucked up but minimizes the nature of the error as much as possible and puts the onus back on anybody who hasn't ""caught up.""

I think a person operating in better faith would approach this fundamentally differently. Something like, ""yeah, I was totally wrong at the beginning of that debate, and it's a shame that this clip keeps circulating, but at least I've corrected myself since then."" I dunno, something at least approaching a more apologetic tone. You gotta accept when you fucked up and own it. The problem is that this is optically ""weaker"" than immediately putting your ""opponent"" back on the defensive while ""refuting"" their claim.

That's the biggest issue with online debate culture, really. ""Looking"" right is not the same thing as being right, but people like Vaush often excel with the former at the expense of the latter, and ""winning"" debates can become this constantly self-reinforcing, subconcious process of confirmation bias. I've personally had my perspective shifted by religious/political debates in the past but the kinds of people who are convinced simply because a debater has the appearance of being an authority on a topic were probably not convinced for very good reasons.

There's a less charitable reading of all this which is that Vaush is just a financially-motivated bad actor at this point, but I can't know what's going on in his head. All I know is that I used to enjoy some of his content, and still think he is an effective communicator and skilled rhetorician, but I've found most of his stuff unwatchable recently, largely due to his overwhelming sense of self-importance and total lack of humility (which has clearly, as you have pointed out here, cultivated a pretty toxic fanbase). For a dude who talks about how much ""the left"" hates him, he sure seems to hate a lot of people on the left.

The last thing I'll say is that I do think that all of this ego-centering, hyper-individualistic inability to admit when you're wrong is as much an inevitable outcome of the world we live in (i.e. capitalism et al.) as it is a character flaw for specific people to work on as needed. Most of us are socialized as children into believing some version of ""great man theory"" and into seeing it as weak to admit you're wrong or be persuaded by an opposing viewpoint. Internalizing that stigma makes it hard to do ourselves. Anybody acting in good faith should be encouraged to overcome that stigma, but digging your heels in is arguably the more predictable response.

But maybe I'm striving for more understanding than is deserved.",2021-09-04 17:33:34,1630794814,0,2,0

I’m usually not shy about replying under my own name, but the deluge of “go fuck yourselves” that came off this comment made me scared to post publicly. I do agree that anorexia is an issue. I have experienced and am still experiencing issues relating to starvation and food control. However, it really is important to decouple obesity and body positivity in this country. It is impossible to carry around a certain amount of excess weight and still be healthy. That said, I have seen beauty at all places on the weight scale. Everybody needs to take a breath, do some serious research, talk to their doctor, and either gain, lose, or maintain according to their height, muscle mass, and intended lifestyle without being influenced by online personas who diss either losing or gaining weight. One person can and should be proud of losing 30 lbs; another of gaining that much.

But for heaven’s sake, don’t let your first instinct on hearing someone’s opinion be “go fuck yourself.” Let it be, “I disagree. Why do you think that?” Let’s work together against the problem, not separately against each other.",2021-09-11 09:03:54,1631369034,1,2,0

I don't know why I decided to check secrets and saw all the ED posts. On that topic, I wish I could go back to the girl in the sixth grade who thought her thighs were a bit too large (they weren't- I was perfectly healthy but I didn't have a thigh gap) and then started to dive deep in whatever diets I could find. In the years since, I've definitely had both restrictive eating habits and bulimia. I'm proud that I'm doing better but I have not had a single meal since where I didn't mentally count the calories or think if I moved enough that day to permit myself the to eat a certain thing. Even though I've been eating healthily for the past couple months (about a year at this point) its been a huge effort to prevent myself from both restricting and bingeing. Honestly, I'm so tired of thinking about it. My whole day revolves around making sure I can eat at the right times because otherwise, I get anxious and its harder for me to eat correctly.",2021-09-12 21:25:55,1631499955,1,0,0

The debates in previous comment sections on if we should care more about obesity vs anorexia as a society was just dangerously uninformed. A group of commenters claimed that 1) obesity is not correlated to health, & 2) anorexia is a far bigger societal issue than obesity. Reality check: 10,200 people very sadly loose their lives every year to anorexia. 300,000 people very sadly loose their lives every year to obesity.

Yes, obviously anorexia is tragic and I have a huge amount of sympathy for people suffering with its burden-which I can’t imagine the full impact of. But (if we want to continue the rather childish insistence of ‘ranking’ issues) obesity is still the most important ‘nutrition’ issue (being much more widespread), and those claiming it has no correlation to health are deluded. It obviously does. We should be concerned about both under and overweight populations in this country, rather than peddling untruths to avoid an honest contemporary conversation about food consumption in America today.",2021-09-12 21:26:50,1631500010,0,0,0

As a female runner, I learned how important it was to maintain a decent amount of body fat. Women and men have very different needs when it comes to exercise and eating because women require more body fat to keep healthy estrogen levels. To women out there who are trying to achieve a certain body type, a really important indicator of health is your period. If you are missing your period— talk to a doctor and make sure you’re not over exercising or under-eating.

If two people were both drinking heavily, obviously neither can give full consent. But if one person doesn’t know that the other person was drunk, and can’t remember that they gave consent (because they were drunk and weren’t sure what they said), there would be reason for them to question if they were assaulted, which is completely justifiable.

But if the other person was also at the same level of intoxication, they would have also been taken advantage of.

So how can situations like these be avoided when people go to these parties and drink and want to hook up?

Should both members sign a contract or something?

Sure, universities are non-profits and have endowments, but they still require yearly income to survive, and their income depends in large part on the quality of their faculty. You chose to go to this expensive university, so you clearly think that there’s something worthwhile about what you’re getting here, so you presumably think that ensuring the survival of the University is a worthy goal even though it doesn’t generate a profit.

Tarantino is a shitty and overrated director. Pulp Fiction isn’t good. It’s just a racist movie that white boys like because it has a lot of gore and they get to imagine an alternate universe where it’s acceptable for them to use the n-word. There is nothing deeper or thought-provoking beneath the surface. That is literally all it is. Tarantino uses his “the movie is in several parts… it skips in time” gimmick to make it seem like he’s doing something new or innovative, but he really isn’t. At the end of the day, it’s yet another violent, hyper-masculine movie– it just doesn’t fully make sense until the end. If it weren’t for this “several parts” gimmick, everyone would realize that this film has no value whatsoever outside of gory spectatorship that entertains frat boys",2021-09-25 02:17:05,1632554225,0,0,0

Hi, this is Hax from the Melee community. I am writing this report in order to alert not only the Melee
community, but also other surrounding esports communities about an incredibly dangerous pattern of
behavior that the Melee community is currently following. From the outside, it may seem that all is
good and well in the Melee community, but that isn’t the case. The truth is that my entire community
has been subjugated by a certain threat over the years, and it doesn’t seem that anyone else sees what I
see anymore. If they do, then they are either too paralyzed with fear to make an impact, or they lack the
platform to do so. With that being said, I ask that you please take the contents of this report seriously,
as there is a lot on the line.

The revised version of the Metagame documentary that is set to air this weekend.

At first, I didn’t want to give the esports world the red pill on what was really going on within the
Melee community. I saw that people were living happily in ignorance, and I didn’t want to change that.
But it seems that every year that goes by, the situation only gets worse. What drew the line for me was
when the filmmaker Samox recently announced that he’d be releasing an edited version of the
Metagame documentary, which is set to air this weekend. I’m eventually going to explain why it
should actually be illegal for this documentary to air, and why the Melee community needs to wake
up to what’s going on.

For those who don’t know me, let me introduce myself and explain why you should trust the contents
of this document. I’ve been in the Melee community for 16 years, having been a top player for many of
those years. Throughout my career, I’ve proven myself to be not only a top player, but also a top
influencer for the community. Although I only have a moderate following, I’ve helped the Melee scene
make technological progress in at least 5 major ways. The most notable thing I’ve done is create an
ergonomic controller called the BOXX, which thousands of Melee players now use in order to avoid
injuring their hands and wrists, but I’ve also done several other things. In 2017, I advocated for in-
game software mods that gave quality-of-life improvements to Gamecube controller users. These were
adopted later that year. Then, in 2019, I explained why Melee needed an anti-stalling rule called a ledge
grab limit. This rule set change was approved shortly afterward as well. Later in 2019, I started hosting
a weekly tournament series called Hax’s Nightclub which showed people that it was viable to play
Melee on LCD monitors. Through the use of the latest technology, my tournament series gave people a
glimpse at what Melee might look like in the future. And finally, starting in 2020, I began making
educational videos that taught people about intricate Melee mechanics. All of my videos went into great
detail about mechanics that people had never heard of before, and were fact-checked several times for
accuracy.

Something to know about all of the innovations I just described is that they all went against the grain.
These were all radical ideas at first, but I helped show that they were the right directions for the
community to go in. The contents of this report will go against the grain as well. However, this report
will have to do with politics rather than technology. People may not realize this, but the Melee
community’s politics are in shambles right now. There is something unthinkably evil going on in front
of our eyes within the Melee community, and I have the evidence to prove it. This report will be tough
to stomach, but the longer the community remains ignorant, the worse the situation will get, and so we
don’t have a choice anymore.

“The greater the crime perpetrated by the leadership, the less likely the people will ever believe their
leaders capable of perpetrating such an event.” - Adolf Hitler

The most difficult part about this document will be accepting that the evil I’m referring to is being
perpetrated by a community leader. There is a community leader who has caused this community to be
filled with hatred, corruption, and greed, which are all things that the Smash community once didn’t
have. These things have become so normalized that the current generation of players doesn’t even seem
to realize what’s going on, and that things weren’t this way before. People are genuinely clueless that
darkness has been cast over the entire Smash community, but hopefully this document will change that.

Before I go any further, let me be clear about the magnitude of this report. This report is the final line
of defense against someone who will continue to threaten the well-being of the Smash community,
as well as surrounding esports communities if he isn’t stopped. The situation will endlessly get worse,
to the point that it’11 become comparable to a reign of terror within esports. I know this to be true based
on three factors. The first one is psychology. I’ve studied psychology extensively in order to bring you
this document, and I know exactly what type of cloth this person is cut from. I’ll be explaining what
constitutes a supremely evil person, as well as how to spot one. I’|l also be going over proven strategies
for manipulating people — especially large crowds of people — that have been used on several occasions.
While it is bad that I’ll be showing you how to manipulate people, it’s worse for you not to know how
the Smash community has repeatedly been manipulated. Finally, I'll be explaining how people with
these personality traits view their so-called “fans and supporters,” and even some of the people who
think that they are their friends.

The next factor is history. I’ve been studying history so that I can show you that what is happening
within the Smash community is 1:1 with what happened in societies that collapsed. We are setting
ourselves up for a dystopia in more ways than people know, and an entire culture shift is going to be
necessary to fix things.

Finally, I will piece everything together with classified information that nobody else has access to.
Most importantly, you need to know the truth about Evidence.zip, which is a collection of documents
that was put together 8 years ago. Evidence.zip is the red pill because it reveals an M.O. that hasn’t
changed, and has only evolved as time has gone on. The press has continuously lied to you about
Evidence.zip, and so you’|l need to drop everything you currently know about it. Evidence.zip will
reveal that several events that have occurred in recent years were politically motivated in ways that the
Smash community didn’t realize, and that there was an agenda in motion the entire time.

I will also be backing everything up with my own personal experiences. I’ve been withholding a ton of
information for this inevitable moment, and it’s time to release all of it. Something I want to apologize
in advance for is the fact that I am going to betray several people’s trust in me in order to bring you the
full truth today. Private information must be leaked in order to tell the full story, and so I’m sorry to
everyone who that affects.

One last thing I want to go over is why I believe this is a groundbreaking document. This document is a
case study for how a community can be uprooted without even realizing it. It will show how platforms
such as Twitter, Twitch, and YouTube can be weaponized in the modern-day era of social media, and
how laws should be implemented to ban certain strategies when it comes to these platforms. Similarly,
this document will show how we, as a society, underestimate the impact of political and psychological
crimes, and how we can’t underestimate crimes that affect socioeconomics and people’s mental health.
It will also show how the esports universe provides the perfect platform for criminology; by constantly
using the excuse that someone is a ‘heel,’ they become able to exploit their community endlessly
without ever being held accountable. All of these things are injustices that call for reform.

Most notably, this document calls for an entire community to undo its way of thinking. There is a cult
of personality that needs to be broken up within the Smash community, and I have a feeling it will be
after people find out what they’ve become a part of.

This is a story of political and psychological warfare that took place in front of your very eyes over the

course of the past decade. As the only person in the entire world capable of telling you this story, I
know that I must do so, as it has the potential to change the timeline we live in.

“This just in: Leffen tweets bad about Ultimate
Tomorrow: people taking Leffen’s word on Ultimate as law

More at 11”

-ESAM (August 24"", 2019)

2 years ago, ESAM emerged as a whistle-blower who stated that he was tired of Leffen shaping the
discourse wherever he went within the Smash community, and having people blindly follow him as
well. ESAM’s posts did incredibly well on Twitter and Reddit. They were clearly representative of

something that lots of people had felt, but may not have had the platform or the courage to express.

For those who don’t know, ESAM is an Ultimate player with about 150,000 followers nowadays,
making him a notable influencer. Meanwhile, Leffen is a Melee player with about 300,000 followers,
making him the current biggest influencer in the Smash community. Leffen’s influence is the biggest
when you consider not only his follower count, but also the credibility that has been assigned to him. It
seems that whenever Leffen speaks, his opinions are regarded as factual, which is what led to ESAM’s
frustrations.",2021-09-25 17:28:17,1632608897,4,5,0

I wake up every morning and check my email and I don't see interview invitations and I immediately feel like I'm going to throw up. I cry like 4-5 times a week about medical school admissions. Every time I see one of those stupid BeMo ads about interviews I get nauseous. Like I know it isn't the end of the world if I don't get into medical school and I know we're still early in the interview season and I know that I had at least solid preparation for this admissions season and there's no reason why I'd believe I'd get rejected everywhere and there's no reason for me to be freaking out but I literally cannot stop panicking like I'm partially convinced I'm going to end up homeless at this point and I know this is almost comical the way I'm writing this but I genuinely unironically think I'm going to end up a failure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer and are even more stressed about admissions than I am and the thought of having to tell them I wasn't admitted anywhere genuinely makes me feel like my lungs are going to give out on me and like I'm goign to have a heart attack.

As someone who recently dropped out (involuntary leave of absence 😉) here are my 2 cents~ When I first came to this school, it felt like it was the key to the rest of my life. As a FGLI it felt like it was the opportunity of a lifetime, and for many of us it can be. For me, life’s worst case scenario became doing poorly in a class. And then it was academic probation. And then suspension. All of those things happened to me and I felt like the rest of my life was fucked. However, once I was out of this environment my perspective changed. I realized UChicago isn’t everything— it’s actually insignificant compared to the rest of the world. I discovered that I’ve been able to rely on my own skill and intelligence to find success [for the m*n out there rolling their eyes, I’ve come to own a bunch of equity in one of my states most profitable startups & am on track to becoming a successful entrepreneur in the cannabis industry as a BIPOC woman. I’m also working a min wage job, which I find very rewarding]. I’ve been through many of our collective “worst case” scenarios and I’ve been able to adapt to it and come out ok. I’ve met all of y’all and I’m confident in your ability to do adapt to whatever is thrown your way. Shit happens, UChicago does not equal life.

I don't want there to be yet another generation of elite college graduates fucking up the world with their misguided senses of ""doing the right thing"" while being completely oblivious to what actually matters.

The ""sch"" in ""bruschetta"" is pronounced ""sk"" and not ""sh"".

Yeah, I said it. It might be tough to hear, you might not even believe me, but this is the truth, whether you like it or not.

I'm pretty sure the reason people pronounce it incorrectly is because they're more familiar with the German trigraph SCH which is pronounced like the English digraph SH. But bruschetta is an Italian word, and in Italian, that's not how it works. In Italian, the letter C can be pronounced two ways: there's the ""hard C"" before the letters A, O, and U, and there's ""soft C"" before I and E. Hard C is pronounced like the English letter K while soft C is pronounced like the English digraph CH. However, there are some cases where you want a hard C sound before an E or an I. In these cases, you append an H after the C. So, the digraph CH, in Italian, is actually pronounced like a hard C, or an English K, in all circumstances. For some more familiar examples, there's ""porCHEtta"", ""gnocCHI"", ""orecCHIette"", or ""macCHEroni"" So the S in ""bruschetta"" is pronounced like S is normally pronounced, and the CH is pronounced like a K. So if I were to convert it to English spelling conventions, it would be pronounced ""broosketta,"" and *not* ""brooshetta"".

(as an aside, if you want to do the opposite and put a soft C in front of an A/O/U, you add an I after the C. So for example, ""ciao"" is pronounced ""chow"" and not ""chyow"". This rule isn't quite as hard-and-fast as the CH rule though, but unless you're actually learning Italian it doesn't really matter. Also, all of the above applies to the letter G as well. A ""funghi"" pizza is pronounced similarly to the English ""fungi,"" while ""giardinera"" is pronounced ""jardinera"" and not ""jiardinera"".)",2021-11-01 07:54:01,1635771241,17,2,0

Abs so sculpted I could see even through his shirt. We had an instant connection. Too bad that’s when she saw him too. My best friend, and now, my enemy.

They started dating a few weeks after we met him. Obviously, she struck first. I, however, would get the last laugh. It all started in Ex-Libris when I bought a glazed donut. I went back from the counter to sit with him and her, eating my donut. I said it was snack time, but it wasn’t the donut I was hungry for.

I ate my glazed donut seductively, looking at him, locking my chocolate brown eyes with his blue. He blushed and looked down. My best friend? Doing a p-set.

Later that night, I received it. A snap. From him. It was smooth and brown, just like my donut.

It couldn’t be.

But it was.

They also have much lower stats than me so I just feel like I somehow F'd my app. I feel like I tried so hard to keep my GPA up at a 'GraDe DefLATing SchOOL"" and got a high MCAT, multiple publications, etc. for no reason at all considering the only two schools that have interviewed me are my state schools which I probably could have gotten into without 70% of my application.

Due to the OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE reception of my ANIME REVIEW, I present to you my MANGA REVIEW. Note I am not an EXPERT in manga as I am in anime, but I still wanted to find some time to discuss them.

Winner: Three Days of Happiness
Runner-up: GTO
Good: Solo Leveling,
Decent: Bloom into You, Mushoku Tensei
Meh: Domestic Girlfriend, Bastard, Grand Blue (longest blue balls personal record)
Bad: Horimiya (dropped), Oyasumi Punpun (dropped), Spy x Family, The Flowers of Evil.

Not sure how to feel about Solo Leveling and its popularity. A well-executed power-fantasy with very bland characters and little substance? Still fun to read. Thoughts?

Anticipate a HENTAI REVIEW next.

Address comments on the ANIME REVIEW:
- Actually haven't fully watched several of them, sorry.
- Re:Zero is trash, but has redeeming themes.
- Steins: Gate only second half is good, first half is awful.
- Kill la Kill deserves to be much lower.
- SNAFU deserves to be lower.
- Azumanga Daioh deserves to be higher.
- Decent (i.e. Black Lagoon) is still recommended, but less so.
- Mob (from only first episode, I know it's not a good sample size) is a worse OPM.

Being around her has been such an unpleasant experience. She recently told me that she has GAD and it adds up, I'm now able to understand her behavior as a reflection of her symptoms. It doesn't change the fact that I hate working with her because being around her is pain, and I've become more self-critical of how I've acted the same way.

1285628101880591,"HENTAI REVIEW

Hentai is bad. Monstrously bad. I have to admit that when consuming it it is difficult to be in a coherent state of mind. Still, I'd like to share with you some interesting didactic examples I've put together. These examples aren't rigorous nor exhaustive--in fact, I don't have any serious research into the genre.

Funniest: Tropical Kiss 1 (+ Mankitsu Happening)
Most shocking: Euphoria
Hentai where middle-aged man goads schoolgirls into fornication for a ""noble"" cause (yuck, stop recommending this to me): everything made by nur
Landlord is a horny (?) loli (just why?): Dokidoki Little Ooyasan
Coolest plot setup: Any plot involving eroge (i.e., Eroge! Sex & Game Make Sexy Games)
Incest with motion sickness (hahahahahahhahahahha): Imouto Paradise
Favorite plot: Uchi no Otouto Maji de Dekain Dakedo Mi ni Konai? (translated ""My little brother is huge as hell. Wanna come over and see?""
Where I learned that vanilla is too vanilla: Kimi ga Suki
Hentai with my favorite character: Knight of Erin

I don’t think it is racist at all to want more ucpd presence or to call out Chicago’s gun violence problem because it IS a problem and everyone deserves to feel safe.

However the reality is most of those people who have to live in those dangerous areas don’t want to those areas to be dangerous be there anymore than you do. Also the racial profiling that occurs.

1285730691870332,"A Proposal to Do Something More This Time:

What occurred on November 9th is of course unbelievably tragic. To attempt to articulate this sentiment in any other terms below would neither be appropriate nor what those closest would likely want to hear at this moment.

For those experiencing a confluence of fear, sadness, anger, and other unknown emotions: you know it could’ve easily been you. I know it could easily have been me. But more heartbreaking, and worst of all, it was yet another one of us.

It is a tragedy compounded by a context of two others like it already among the university community in a single year, compounded further still by a context of a city in which this problem seems both as old as memory serves and freshly worsening with each passing year – cutting lives short across neighborhood lines and walks of life. We know this is not normal here, and should not be normal anywhere – that to still simply go on without any reflection on what can be done next, would be the greatest travesty of all.

The part I fail to understand? Here, in this small rectangle of land between Hyde Park Blvd and 63rd street, Cottage Grove and Lake Shore Drive, we have some of the most intelligent young minds in the world, some of the most influential connections anywhere, some of the leading experts in every conceivable field, some of the most cutting-edge technology and resources imaginable, a higher concentration of wealth and resources than perhaps anywhere else in the city, and a rich history of those who decided to go against the status quo when it mattered. And yet, we have the audacity here to pass along the bill of trying to reduce violence in Chicago, to others in this city - simply hurling reprimands when it is left unpaid through perceived inaction. Why not us? Why can’t we do this? What ingredients for change-making are we missing that we are waiting for someone else to come in and really make a concerted effort towards fixing things? Why can’t we be the ones to get right what for so long has been a blight on this city, on the people and families that make up its very heart and soul?

I really mean it. Throughout history, university students demanding change around the world have long been responsible for starting tectonic shifts in societies. They’ve protested wars with their lives on the line, been the impetus for the passage or stoppage of landmark laws, stared down fascist dictators with their words, and toppled entire governments. If you believe this to be exaggeration, a quick google search would only prove my underselling the power of students when firmly behind a cause in large numbers. Maybe this is our time to also fight for something bigger than ourselves. Rather than just accept more of the same, or hang on to fear and helplessness, perhaps we are being called upon by the moment to form something that expresses we really mean enough is enough. If making a legitimate attempt to reducing the senseless cycle violence on the streets of this city is going to start anywhere, let’s let it start here: a University full of youthful energy, optimism, and thinking – standing atop an influential and resource-laden platform, and who will absolutely not back down the pressure on power and institutions until real changes in violence all over this city are actually seen.

I don’t make claims to know more than any of you, to feel more deeply than any of you, to empathize more than any of you and in fact, would actively make claims to the opposite. But I do believe that big change is possible in the rare moments when a group of people look at the big problems, and stop viewing them as unsolvable by their own hands – when they set aside the arguments that would bog them down and face a clear goal with determination.

Let’s start a real movement here, one with legs to keep moving, and with arms to push tangible obstacles out of the way. Let’s not get caught in the traps of “continued dialogue” and promises of a “stronger commitment to our communities”. Let's be about loud action this time. Let’s be more than a reaction of sadness the morning after, more than some fear that afternoon, and a passing frustration that night. Maybe we don’t stop demonstrating until we see tangible changes in legislation and the city’s strategy to fight crime. Maybe we refuse attendance at classes/activities for a day or longer in recognition of all that those who have been victims of senseless gun violence in this city will miss, and instead sit in on the University’s offices or even city hall to demand change. Maybe we take a deep and objective look at the data from gun violence in other cities by leveraging the public health, statistics, and public policy experts of this school, and work with our wealth of scholars in all fields to design a comprehensive list of reforms that this city can enact to actually try and make a dent in homicides and crime. Maybe we make such a big stink about violence in this city, one that hasn't been seen at any other University yet, that a whole array of media and politicians (both of which, it should be noted, already hold deep, existing connections to the school) has no choice but to engage seriously with our issues. If not now, then when?

And for once, let’s not lose ourselves in the tangential concerns, in the twists and turns that debates about the means of implementation will perhaps take us. There will be plenty who want nothing more than to see this happen – who will provide as many complicating hypotheticals and factors as there are people to hear them, and will watch eagerly as we implode early and on our own terms because we weren’t unified enough around at least the very fundamental motivations from which we started and the tangible goals and results to which we know we need to arrive. We can’t approach this problem head on, if we’re divided at our very foundations. Maybe we can start from a point of genuine mutual respect for one another in the idea that, at the most basic level, the loss of human life is something we are all inherently against. This is the basis of humanity and to start from a place where you deny even the possibility of this for some of your peers for whatever political position they may hold, is to deny them of this humanity just as they so easily could do to you, all towards no net sum.

To those who ask, why now? Who claim that only when the problem hits close to home, do we feel an obligation to the community. That our inherent privilege as students here should preclude us from speaking out on the topic. To these individuals I question in return, to what end does your cynicism hold? When the ones who have known and suffered longest from this senseless violence have long spoken only to deaf ears, is it not the responsibility of a student body with the wind of influence and power to create change at its back, to step up the most – even if it comes only after the issue lands repeatedly upon its doorstep?

Maybe there will be those who continue to claim this an unsolvable problem - the complete fault of group X and something that group Y’s approach would never allow to happen – and in the process, let apathy replace attempt. Maybe there will be those who continue whining about their own personal inconveniences, sitting back while lambasting the “powers that be” for not making a more concerted effort to do something. Maybe there are some who are content to send out the words “Our city struggles with many of the same issues of violence that afflict all large cities in the U.S.” in the same email announcing the death of yet another student.

But I know that if enough of us truly believe that things don’t have to be this way, big things can happen. Maybe this is a point in time, where we are being called on to affect change in a larger way than we can imagine. Perhaps this is the turning point in the fight to keep our city safer, where one day, communities without their slain children on the streets, can look back and point to the movement students here started - one that took gun violence in the city on its face, refused to simply accept what was already being done, and engaged with it in uniquely objective and results-oriented ways - as being a key reason why.

Even one unnecessary death reflects a failure on all of us. Why should we let this happen in silence? Like it or not, if you are here, you are a part of this city. So let’s make it better. Let’s do something. For real this time.

One of You",2021-11-11 21:27:57,1636687677,14,3,0

1. Increase the frequency of shuttles. Make it an all day round thing, not just the evenings.
2. Increase UCPD patrols in the area. I know police brutality is a problem against POCs but police can be held accountable if they do something wrong. There is no way you can hold gangs accountable for the atrocities they commit. If give every student a UChicago branded mask if you’re worried about wrongful profiling, and train UCPD better to prevent mishaps. Also increase UCPD presence in the area, not just for a few days but for good.

2) on the topic of complaints, more community members need to sit on the independent review committee(IRC).

1287502611693140,"I'm sorry but if you want to direct your rightful anger and fear at somebody during this chain of tragic murders, you need to direct it at the UChicago administration and particularly the people most responsible for consolidating wealth and institutionalizing suffering for a large majority of the population. They systematically silence the voices of anyone trying to address the underlying causes of this epidemic of violence, and that's because they know that their wealth and prestige literally relies on the exploitation of the poor and despairing in this country and around the world. Any attempt to address the factors underlying these tragic murders means challenging a regime of capital accumulation. It would mean a serious conversation about the existence of a project like UChicago as an elite institution and agent of mass gentrification in the Southside period.

The backlash against the abolish UCPD and defund UCPD movements is understandable, especially when those movements seem privileged and largely white (although tbh that's not really true that abolition is just a bunch of white ppl... ). Most of that discourse misses the point of prison/police/PIC abolition. Not a single abolitionist worth their salt wants to just abolish the police tomorrow. It's a vision, horizon, and practice. The point is, a surveillance state police force cannot, clearly did not, and never will stop tragic murders such as these. That can only happen by building a world where murder is unthinkable, which happens through strong communities and transformative/restorative community accountability practices in the face of harm. Presence not absence.

Which, again, direct your anger at admin because they're the ones who categorically refuse to seriously engage the teachings and practices of PIC abolition as anything but an impossible joke. In declaring their intent to partner with Mayor Lightfoot and increase CPD's presence, they've made it very clear that they plan to repeat the same mistakes.

Community activism is great and hearing from local leaders is great, but something tells me the guys responsible for these deaths aren’t exactly pillars of Hyde Park or the South Side in general. So it’s not like the exposure there would lead to some sort of weird friendship between UChicago students and potential shooters. Besides, when students are actively targeted (typically for robbery) it’s because they 1) almost certainly have valuables (electronics) and 2) are easy targets (unarmed or can’t fight). Not because Hyde Park residents don’t like UChicago, regardless of if that’s true.

As for reform? Yeah reform is a good thing and probably will help long term, but generally takes a while.

Why can't people just get off the extreme ideologies and look at the facts:

- increase in policing decreases crime (papers that demonstrate this typically demonstrate causality, instead of the large number of association studies which fail to separate reverse causality, e.g.: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418829500096221, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951346 (somewhat of a meme, but the results still hold after the correction), https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00240.x, https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/426877)
- the deterrence effect is real (https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670398)
- incarceration reduces reoffending rates (https://yotamshemtov.github.io/files/Rose_Shemtov_2021_Manuscript.pdf)
- lax gun laws increase homicide rates (https://secureservercdn.net/45.40.146.38/3c2.7cc.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Colmer_Doleac_Apr2021.pdf)
- poverty is associated with crime (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176507000201?casa_token=NCuuEA9XoXMAAAAA:X5QVSdEDD-z9Vz_GQmOqzVbk5Ecxi7m9N0r47_GmxMUrn2ItrbMPpWg_SIl-u0PVOYGraQ)

Unfortunately, the solution to crime requires policies that neither the left nor the right fully embrace. But if people keep fighting back and forth on Tucker Carlson or defunding the police or whatever, this shit is never going to get solved. What's worse is that the people who are most passionate about this debate on crime aren't Asian or blacks. It's white ultraliberals and white ultraconservatives arguing back and forth while Asians and blacks are dying from dysfunctional policing and dysfunctional levels of crime.

We need to:

1. increase policing

Police is an oppressive institute by nature, just as state and capitalism. However, in many countries of the world, the police are much less oppressive than here and actually maintain decent social orders. Instead of ranting about defunding the police, perhaps look at other countries and think about how you can make police here less racist and oppressive. I do hope we can see a world where individuals live freely without forms of power suppressing them politically and economically, but unfortunately, this vision is far away.

I don't believe anyone can genuinely argue that there is a better alternative to the police in dealing with violent crime.

That being said, a student was literally shot to death right next to campus in the middle of the day. It wasn't an accident, nor a case of mistaken identity, nor an altercation, nor any other reason you can think of. This is by definition the most violent crime we could possibly witness right here on campus.

I think the initial ideas around defund the police were quite sound, but you cannot simply use a catchphrase as your end goal. What is ucpd's role? I think they have almost exclusively focused on crime, which should be the main focus of a police force.

We can argue about how many officers there should be, how often they should patrol, etc. But at the end of the day, if we defund ucpd, those who are able to afford better safety will chose such options (taking ubers everywhere, living in a gated complex, possibly hiring private bodyguards or whatnot).

Bro I don’t get this shit when ppl say “lol UChicago people are so sheltered they don’t think the green line is safe”

I have literally had some creepy dude touch me or shout racially and sexually charged stuff at me 90% of the times I have ever walked onto public transit that wasn’t the 171 or 172. I don’t feel safe on public transit not because I’m some sheltered suburban racist, but because experience has taught me that I. AM. NOT. SAFE. THERE.

I am regularly cat called and followed by men in cars and on foot, when I’m on campus and off!? Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do??? So many people’s suggestions smell like victim blaming couched in sosc-class leftist dialogue. Like bro…some dude started touching me on the red line when I was wearing baggy sweatpants and a hoodie, but somehow it’s not his fault for doing that, because of the socioeconomic circumstances surrounding his life - that’s laughable.

I am an Asian-American student who was physically assaulted because of my race this year at the red line. I was waiting at the platform when a man called me ch*nk, ripped my mask off, and lunged at me attempting to push me off the platform as the train to Howard arrived. Had I been a couple steps closer to the edge of the platform or had a bystander (a Black local, mind you) not stepped in, the remnants of my corpse would have likely laid on the tracks of Garfield for all to see.

I'm sure all of you are aware of this (and especially my fellow POC, asian or not), but feeling like you're being discriminated against because of your race is painful and that pain is real. For months after that incident I felt like I couldn't breathe on the platform or on the red line, regardless of where on the line I was. I still can't wear my hair the same way I wore it that day, and I can't wear the same clothes I wore that day. The truth of the matter is that here, Asians are perceived to be weak, helpless, and defenseless, and even if something were to happen to us, we'd keep our head down and say nothing. Maybe that's why we've seen so many Asian students harassed, assaulted, and killed recently here; maybe that's why Asian elders were consistently assaulted during the pandemic; maybe that's why my family was constantly threatened, mocked, and harassed by our neighbors growing up; maybe that's why I was followed by a van for hours when I was 16 while the driver drove past me telling me how much he loved asian girls until my parents found me cowered crying in the Kmart shoe section. This mindset isn't central to any race; it's a societal issue that leads to people (of all backgrounds, all races, and all shapes and sizes) believing that we're weak cowards who'll take anything with our heads down. It hurts like hell and it hurts even more for someone to insinuate it's our faults because we didn't look or dress the right way because I'm here this year on nearly full financial aid, and even if I wasn't, it shouldn't be happening. The Asian community, and especially the Chinese international community, is hurting. That hurt is real and that hurt is valid.

But there are two communities here hurting- two communities that have been pitted against one another since they started coexisting. Pain and anger and grief make people irrational, but that irrationality shouldn't have implications on how we view an already discriminated and disenfranchised community and race. I've seen members of my own community make this a race issue when being a heartless murderer has nothing to do with race. I will never defend the acts of any individual who does things with the intentions of harming anyone- we could extrapolate and claim it was desperation, and we can say that they were the product of their surroundings, all of which is 100% true, but take it from me that returning home after nearly being hit by a train because of my race and being slapped with ""don't blame the individual, it's not their fault, they only did what their circumstances allowed them to"" is one of the most invalidating feelings you could face.

But there's a difference between demanding accountability for the individual involved and insinuating that this is the fault of an entire race of people and an entire community. Don't we know how it feels to be blamed for something we took no part in condoning, especially after this pandemic? Don't we understand how it feels to be hit with a label because of the color of our skin? Are there some truly evil individuals out here? Of course. But remember that when I was nearly pushed into an oncoming train, it was the locals who intervened, made sure I was okay, and gave me their spare masks. Whether you like it or not, this city is our home for however long we decide to stay here for. We have a right to live in peace and safety without fear of discrimination, but so do the communities who've called this place home for longer than we have.

I can't give a proclamation of what actions we should take to make sure this doesn't happen again. Reconciling with our neighboring communities, community outreach, and redistribution of wealth are all important long-term solutions, but as a secret said, these will take years. Is expanded policing the best short-term solution? Probably not, but I admit I am nowhere near well-read enough to make any claims on that end. But something that I know would help is if all of you had a little more fucking empathy for those who disagree with you. We don't know what the other's gone through; we don't know what they're feeling, and chances are, we never will. I know this language flowery and pretentious and the epitome of why UChicago kids suck, but I'm tired of the hypocrisy going on here and I'm tired of people hearing but not listening.

TLDR: this is such a shitty situation for everyone so have some fucking empathy, even for those you don't agree with",2021-11-16 22:17:44,1637122664,30,0,0

1289439504832784,"A couple of points:
- I know UCPD can't solve the overall crime and poverty issue but at least it can to some degree stop more students from dying, which is the problem we are trying to tackle now. When we find a good solution to crimes that doesn't marginalize people (which neither side of the political isle currently has), we can phase policing out. A temporary solution is always better than letting things fester, especially when the problem is something as lethal as gun violence.
- I assume we all came here knowing that there is a non-zero probability (and one higher than most places in the US) where we get involved in violent crime during our stay here but three murders around me in a single year is still too much and demands attention and action from those with power.
- Shame on the people who are victim blaming and saying ""he should've known better and not walked around in Canada Goose and a headphone."" The murderer/criminal is always the one who's wrong by definition unless you think killing someone isn't wrong. Also, Dennis came from a single-parent family and his mom is a retired nurse from a third-tier city in China. His family went into a lotta debt to put him through college in HK and the master's program here. I've read stuff his friends wrote about him and he was a frugal and careful person who probably wouldn't waste money on Canada Goose so stop racial profiling any Asian kid as rich ass spoiled bastards and stop sympathizing with the murderer simply because he's a black kid from an impoverished part of the city.
- ""No one is forcing you to be here"" lol sounds like something a Karen would say just saying
- Stop being liberal for the sake of being liberal. EMPATHY is more important than political agenda
- You can't just dismiss crime and murder as ""a part of city life"" and attack and ridicule people who are scared of them because A. in general people don't want to get murdered and B. there are world-class cities where you don't have to worry about getting robbed or murdered on the daily. In fact, there are metropolitan cities where you can pass out on the streets at 2 AM and still find your wallet on you the next morning - I lived in one. Living in a neighborhood where you have to worry about getting shot every day is not something people can take pride in, at least I can't see non-natives taking pride in that.",2021-11-17 14:37:11,1637181431,7,0,0

They are just students who haven't even earned their degrees yet, and we don't even know the academic background of the neighbors. I looked through those and I couldn't really find anything about what the students and neighbors studied. Maybe they just haven't published their papers yet. I just find it a little concerning that a lot of students (and maybe some admin) seem to be swayed by the sheer volume of people who signed the letter. Obviously students can and should make their opinions known, and it's possible for people to be knowledgeable about safety issues outside of the focus of their research. It just seems like the people we should be looking to in these situations are those who have dedicated their careers to studying crime and ucpd's influence on Hyde Park and southside. And if those people haven't backed the cnc letter - in fact, I don't think anyone has dedicated their careers to this specific area - then maybe students should be more skeptical of its content?

1291480121295389,"Short answer is that GPA matters, but the degree to which it matters differs on a lot of factors. High-level banking/consulting/finance jobs that pay six figures out the gate often have a GPA cutoff of 3.7 at least; top law schools also want you to have similarly high GPAs. Your major also has a lot to do with it. I suspect that your fellow sorority sisters with high GPAs going into business majored in econ or something similar, and it is not as difficult to get high GPAs in those fields as it is in, say, MEng or Physics or pre-med. Unfortunately, if you have a 3.0 and you're, say, an econ major, you are probably shut out of most top business/finance jobs for the time being. That isn't to say that you won't find a job, or that you won't find a job that pays decently, but it will be harder, and the pay will almost certainly not be six figures. I have some friends who've graduated in the past few years who majored in econ, pub pol, sociology, law letters, etc. and some of them with mid to low GPAs are working at coffee shops right now (which, to be clear, isn't bad, but I suspect that that's not what the OP is looking for). Conversely, I know people with mid GPAs from my own sorority who are working at middle-tier business/law firms, and some people with high GPAs who aren't making as much as their high GPAs would indicate. It's very case-by-case, and I'm assuming that you're looking for these six-figure kind of opportunities, but it's also important to realize that maybe these people who are saying ""GPA doesn't matter"" are saying that because they don't necessarily want those opportunities that are only available to those with high GPAs (and thus GPA doesn't matter to *them*).",2021-11-20 20:19:19,1637461159,4,0,0
