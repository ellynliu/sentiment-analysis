"Hi. Today’s my 21st birthday and I’m feeling really upset. I don’t really have any friends at school nor at home. My family’s more or less all I’ve got. My Mom and Dad went out of their way to make a really huge Paddle Tennis event with about 30 of my Dad’s friends today. (The vast majority being people whom I’ve never met before.) They’re all playing / boozing in my backyard. I think my Dad forgot that it was my birthday today. The alternative is that he does know, he would just rather drink and play paddle? I don’t plan on going outside and exposing myself to a bunch of total strangers. (Especially given the fact that I’m immunocompromised.) If I voiced any reasonable concern over a gathering of about 30 people during a pandemic, then I’d be told to “leave if I had a problem”. I’m so hurt by this. I’ve been randomly bursting into tears throughout the day when no one’s around me. So yea, here’s my depressing secret about how my parents are having a huge party on my 21st without me."

"Lol what happened to ""The Chicago Thwomp does not not oversee the commentary in its comments sections""? None of the comments I've posted in like the past week have been published. I thought they supported the free marketplace of ideas or something. Also, the Thinker comment section is unironically now a place where people discuss politics, and they should know by now that section 230 of the CDA protects them from legal action for libelious/otherwise illegal speech, so obviously the reason they have this policy in place is not to shield them from liability, but to silence those who don't agree with them. Their stifling of free speech on their own platform is almost certainly going to turn their comments section into an echo chamber in the long run. ""We refuse to be coddled"" my ass."

"Piece of advice for my mediocre gpa classmates: Deluding yourself into believing a low gpa demonstrates a superior personality, more friends, or a better college experience — and the worst: gpa doesn't matter — is a sad and pathetic cope.

Roasting everyone who made more sacrifices, worked harder and performed better than you makes you look immature, dumb and insecure. You screwed up, just admit it."

I'm not deprived of all physical contact, but it's the physical contact in the context of romance that I really want. I feel like when it comes to dating, my standards are too high because I want to meet someone through an organic interaction rather than through a dating app, but then I feel like I can't complain when nothing happens since I'm not taking any initiative. At this point, even though I'm only a sophomore, I feel like my chances of having a relationship in college are pretty much shot."
there needs to be an equivilant to guys for ladies. i feel weird calling people men and women cause like we r bunch of kids but we arent boys or girls either. so for men you just call them guys. for example if you are hanging out with men u say im hanging out with some guys. but if im hanging out with with women u say im hanging out with _____. yes i know technichlly i can say galls but that feel too southern. So i feel weird cause im not trying to degrade women when i say girls but it often comes out like that.

 LOL all the dense motherfuckers in the comments making false comparisons. Sure, choosing to fuck raw is the same thing as accidentally falling or getting injured. Mhm. Ok, it’s the same thing as becoming addicted to smoking. Yea for
sure. Get better comparisons. OP is correct in saying that the vast majority of people who get abortions are people who *chose* not to use contraceptives, and to live with the consequences.

It is so so easy to put on a condom, and if you somehow think that it’s the same thing as saying “it is so so easy to not have accidental injury/not smoke/etc” then you are making a stupid argument.

Abortion is lit, abortion is healthcare, fuck them kids. BUT your guys’ argument sucks dick. Give me more irrelevant points about how 1% of abortions are health related, incest, rape, etc etc. Yeah Yeah."

Second, OP said they wanted to feel better about their grades and I don’t think feeling good about yourself through other people’s insecurities and failings is the way to do it. Delete it finals is not the time for people to be anguishing over the fact that they’re failing a class while other UChicago students have never done worse than a B."
"Do you remember when Rachel Fulton Brown was “exposed” and the girl who posted the meme started daring the Thinker to come after her and calling herself famous. No explicit hate to her but we need to acknowledge that that is something we would only hear out of a white person’s mouth. I would be terrified if the conservative group at this school knew who I was, much less came for me. That would literally be getting doxxed to white supremacists. Yet she can get excited about it cause “she’s famous now”. This isn’t about fame BIPOC students were not actually elevated through this it was a bunch of white people praising a white girl who made it about herself instead of the people actually affected by Brown’s white supremacy. If you’re going to be an ally use your fame to let BIPOC speak."

Too far left: Abolishing private property"

"Everyone deserves to love themselves. Ppl commenting on fat men being left out of body positivity are right!! But, that doesn't mean fat women are your enemies.

Fat men suffer so much social pain because of weight and you'd be a gaslighting fool to insist otherwise. But, that doesn't mean that fat women have it any better. Consider how exclusively highlighting fat female bodies as sex objects/sex appeal in media might be another function of misogyny.

If it were men and women equally, I'd accept it as body positivity, but to me most of the media campaigns seem more like attempts to further capitalize on women as sex objects. Body positivity should mean that everyone's bodies are beautiful and that needs to be evident in the images and messages that are spread with body positivity at the fore. Fat men deserve to be equally loved and represented.

Not that it inherently matters to the argument, but I was just surprised that you could argue for something so vehemently when you don't even know a single participant or anything about it.

"What does knowing players have to do with arguing for reduction of a gendered pay gap? I don't know the names of most people in most professions - I'm sure there are professions I don't even know exist. Nevertheless, I believe equal work deserves equal pay. The former domain of knowledge is immaterial to the stance being argued. It sounds as though they're arguing over something they very much understand (the pertinent aspects of). Your confusion suggests that you, willfully or not, are the only one arguing over something without bringing to the table a full understanding."

"It's really weird to think that every second I spend alive is a second I'll never get back, and that yeah I'm young now but that's going to fade faster than I'm ready for . I'll get back problems and a mortgage and I'll start muttering negative opinions about what the kids do for fun these days, and then one day I'll die. There is still so much out in the world for me to experience--I could travel the world, learn a new language, learn that new skill I've always thought seemed cool, write a book (man I've always wanted to write a book), and on and on. I've got so much life left, and I'm at a point in my life where I'm about to have the freedom to do anything and everything. It is a unique and temporary opportunity that I have to take advantage of with urgency, lest I lose it forever.

But I won't, because all those things are hard and I could fail at them, and failing at things is scary--certainly much scarier than the joy I would feel if I somehow succeeded at them.

Welp, back to the pretty glowing rectangles I guess."

Apparently, they just didn't let her get any mental health help despite her clearly asking and needing it; when they finally budged, they said she would have to REAPPLY to the college to get her spot back after the help. wtf? I thought we had it bad."
"I don’t have any eligible condition, but I got an invitation from UChicago Health to make an appointment for a covid vaccine. It’s okay for me to take it, right? I think there’s a lottery system or something for past patients there. They’re a major hospital so they know what they’re doing and they wouldn’t have sent out the invitation if they didn’t want me to accept it, right?"

The Secrets post asking for help and the accompanying comments remind me of this:

"cant believe people are actually defending people who are so materialistic and insecure that they have to flaunt their bodies and pretty faces on the internet for social validation

"Friendly reminder to the poll party peeps and fellow leftists that gulags were concentration camps where over 1,600,000 people died. We can support communism while still acknowledging and condemning the horrific crimes of the past. Making jokes about gulags is not okay, nor is making jokes about any other mass murder of civilians by the state. I’m a prison abolitionist and I know a lot of you guys are too, and it shouldn’t be considered any more acceptable to joke about gulags than it is to joke about mass incarceration today."
"How do I get an internship? I have met with people from Career Advancement, applied to over thirty jobs, and still have no offers. I am interested in behavioral sciences but don't know who to talk to the BSci guy was not helpful."

"there’s this really hot guy that i’ve seen at the gym, he looks like borat and has a mad side part, kinda short tho around like 5’11 but the british accent (that seems to only come around when girls are around) is super hot! single? into guys?"

"I worked hard for multiple years. I did everything that was asked of me. And instead of giving me a chance, you put people in a position they weren't ready for. That's what takes the cake for me. Not only was giving me a chance the right thing to do, it would have been better for the organization as a whole."
"He didn’t ‘make jokes’ about COVID, he joked that he hoped that people didn’t skip classes for trivial reasons, only if they had COVID or something similar. He immediately said that that came out wrong, and apologised. The guy has a sense of humour, and it isn’t hurting anyone.

As for the PSETs, they have always been ‘increasingly difficult’ in every class I have taken here; at least this guy is honest about it🙄

But on that note I don’t like how we were left to solve MATLAB with just two tutorial sheets and office hours help- he could’ve spent some time going over it in class, especially for people who don’t know the first thing about coding."

"occasionally — not every day, heck, not even every week! — poll party will produce the worst fucking god-awful content (both in terms of posts and comments) i have ever had the misfortune of seeing in all my years at uchicago, and like three people are responsible for close to 100% of that content."
I love all the squealing regarding private school kids. By that defective logic those kids should ask their parents to send them to a shitty public school(I went to one).
"I understand wanting to create a sense of community on poll party, especially in light of the pandemic, but some of the questions being posted are just absurd and weirdly personal to the point of being inappropriate. I wouldn’t be surprised if in the near future someone posts: “What’s your dick size (in)? BONUS: cut/uncut?”"

"Last night I was the victim of a hate crime. I was walking to my apartment from Nella wearing my Adidas shoes, UChicago shirt and MAGA hat. As I was walking by, minding my own business, a bus spray painted “BIDEN RULES” pulled up next to me. Then, a bunch of purple haired leftists in hammer and sickle shirts came out and attacked me. Luckily, I had my AK-47 on me, so I was able to get out of there without any injuries. However, no one believed me when I said I got attacked! It’s really sad how the left resorts to violence in order to silence conservatives. It’s fucked up that the university lets them get away with this"

"Vaccinated people can be carriers (albeit at what preliminary trials suggest is a reduced rate). The reason the CDC advises you still wear masks indoors (excluding small, fully-vaccinated groups), is primarily an effort to reduce not only the presence of negative effects but the presence of the virus itself, which in turn will curb the risk of further mutations. The CDC definitely has *not* said vaccines allow you to stop wearing a mask altogether, in the absence of herd immunity.

Their advice for masks is linked right on their front page, you'd literally have to try and miss it."

Yo fuck the language requirement. Literally gets in the way of more interesting classes that would serve at least some purpose beyond graduation requirement filler and taking 3 slots. Would prefer if everyone just spoke English so everyone would understand each other and there would be no need for language requirements and studies (seriously imagine how much more can be done by removing the language barrier) but we all know thats a pipedream.
"Spent some time on the quad today and was extremely happy to see people not wearing their masks while outside if fully vaccinated. Love seeing people enjoying themselves and fully following the guidance of the most informed and educated scientists on the planet. Go science! (Not shaming people who do wear masks, keep going, there's no judgement, I'm just happy that science and hard work and vaccinations have allowed us to get this far where it is safe for people to do this)"
"So i have an issue. I kind of want to move back to housing, but i wouldn't be able to participate in selection until June, but I'm worried if i wait that long there won't be any decent rooms left off campus.

It'd be a real dick move if what OP said is true and someone really gave their info to them."

"With all due respect, if not now/soon, then when? All signs point to Covid becoming a perennial issue that we will have to deal with. If we don't start normalizing walking around outside without a mask on 2 weeks post-final dose, how can we justify ever doing it? Or any other activities we consider normal? I understand wanting to be cautious but we are eventually going to have to reckon with the trade-offs of risk vs normalcy, as we do with the annual flu. And if the CDC says it's fine for me to walk around outside without a mask I am going to follow their advice, as I have been doing for the entirety of this pandemic."
"Sounds like you just don't know how to use cinnamon correctly. You're right that cinnamon is great in sweet contexts like fried dough, but it's also amazing in savory applications when done properly. We're talking throwing a cinnamon stick into a curry/stew/chili, etc. Adds a great aroma to a whole bunch of things.
But what you're doing is basically the equivalent of dipping a biscotti in mayonnaise because it's too dry. Yes, mayonnaise can make stuff moister. Yes, it can even be used in desserts. But this course of action really shouldn't be the logical conclusion of either of these facts if you have even the tiniest shred of common sense."

I took a walk outside today, and honestly I was astounded at the feeling of spring. It's so blue and bright and colorful now, it's impossible not to smile at it. The winter looked nice, but I personally enjoy this more. It's nice to see people walking around surrounded by green - there's this sense of life that I welcome wholeheartedly.

I suggest you all do the same if you find the time, take a walk by yourself in the areas with trees, vines, and flowers around - It's very refreshing.

Take another google images picture of flowers - this one is an amaryllis, I hope to have some of my own to show some day in the future."

Because Israel is very ethnically diverse and you do not in any way have to be Jewish to be Israeli.

"The issue with the CDC policy change on masks reminds me a bit of their initial policy on masks. With incomplete information that partially favored airborne transmission but fearing that people would rush and take high quality masks that were needed in medical settings, people were told to use no masks at all (when cloth masks would have been far more effective). Or similarly, Dr. Fauci's admissions that he raises up the number required for herd immunity based off how people responded to being likely to get a vaccine. We can worry about how these new guidelines could create downstream impacts (people lying about being vaccinated and wearing no mask in an indoor setting), but it perfectly reflects the body of knowledge we have on vaccines and vaccine effectiveness in stopping COVID-19 transmission and having public health officials demonstrably lie about the research is a recipe for perpetuating low trust in the CDC and other public health institutions."

These are issues that came up since the last time this course was taught here, so duh he’d take half a day to figure it out and send clarifications.

And about the midterms- he’s grading MORE THAN A HUNDRED himself. It’s been 2 and a half weeks; the poor guy is doing his best- stop being arrogant, whiny, condescending, judgemental snowflakes about it.

He’s a great lecturer honestly and is great at solving difficulties or clarifying concepts (which you would know if you actually bothered to show up to class).

Calm down and stop the incessant whinging and grow up for your own sakes."
"I’m vaccinated, but I do not agree with the school requiring the vaccine. At least not yet. For one simple reason: it is still only authorized by the FDA under EMERGENCY use. I think it is more than okay for the school to require it once it is fully approved. However, I do understand the need to curb the pandemic rapidly, so on that note it would make sense to require it. Tough call."

Secrets has literally always been this way. America wasn’t greater in the past. Kids these days aren’t worse than older generations. It’s like this weird form of escapism like I guess it’s comforting to think things can be better than they are now, but it’s weird to me to look to the past for that."

I was (mostly) with you until you made it this weird thing about students not working hard enough?

"What American media seems to have underreported is that Israel was literally a day or two from ousting Netanyahu from government before this war happened. In a parliamentary system these changes in PM don’t have an exact date and depend on coalition formation. Everyone knew the new coalition deal which would have shown Netanyahu the door was at most days away from being signed ! Many in Israel believe the current escalation is too convenient to be a coincidence. Remember too that this is happening after a 4th consecutive election in which Netanyahu failed to secure a stable majority. And even now - even if the war bought him a few more months at such a bloody price - at most he can get another elections (no. 5), not an outright mandate to rule. He does not have the trust of the Israeli people (a stable parliamentary coalition) and hasn’t for over two years now. Both polls and elections show most people want him out and eventually he’ll run out of tricks."

Due to this similarity in appearance, the creator of the image determined that it would be comical (i.e. produce a reaction of laughter and/or humor in the viewer) to superimpose the territorial boundaries of Israel and Palestine onto the aforementioned state of Delaware (USA)."

"There are likely going to still be students (mostly international) who still won't be able to come to campus next year, so it seems like there will still be remote components in the fall quarter. To solve your dilemma here I think the university should still allow unvaccinated people to take courses remotely, just not come to campus. It makes the most sense since we want to maintain the safety of individuals here and getting vaccinated isn't necessarily a ""personal"" decision when it comes to public health. It will also probably help the school avoid a lawsuit about some student complaining that they were forcibly vaccinated."

I understand your point and am often frustrated with the pervasive antisemitism that exists in a lot of leftist circles. I still think that neocolonial theory is useful for understanding what is happening in Israel/Palestine right now. While Jewish people are indigenous to Israel, many to most of the US conservatives that support Israel are not Jewish (and some of them are white supremacists). The fact is that a lot of American and European interests in the Middle East depend on the state of Israel existing in it's current form. So no, zionists and Israeli jews are not colonists, but the billions and billions of dollars the US has given to Israel in military aid over the years is absolutely a form of colonial power."

Yes, some of what people say may be true, but a Facebook group is most certainly not the place to gather facts about such sensitive issues. As University of Chicago students, you all should really know this. Nobody here should feel at all within their rights to be disseminating information without citing proper sources (and to those who have included links to reputable sources, good job). I see WAY too many comments making very serious claims, posting pixelated infographics, or making statements that may or may not be true. Please go to reputable sources to learn the real stories instead of listening to an anonymous post or a first year UChicago student in the comments section."

It's offensive and wrong to suggest that a persecuted group give up a place for them to feel safe. Call for reform, the election of more humanitarian minded officials, and an end to the mistreatment of Palestinians (which is definitely occuring).

"Actually, do take ECON 202 with Chris Roark. He is one of the best econ profs I’ve had here- gives an excellent understanding of the intuition of what’s going on. Very helpful in OH.

The only people complaining incessantly about him are the ones who never showed up to live classes where he went over much of the intuition. These are the same people who don’t even watch the lecture recordings and then bombard the gc thousands of times with the same questions about how many psets/weekly Qs he will drop- stuff he has clarified multiple times in class, which they would know if they bothered to show up or even watch the videos.

This is ridiculous. If you were under the influence and someone came and legitimately choked or stabbed you, then is the cause of death the alcohol in your body? No. There is no evidence that fentanyl killed him. This is only from people who are trying to make excuses to continue the oppression of blacks at the hands of police. To put it plainly, George Floyd was alive, breathing, walking, and talking before he had a knee to his neck. To claim otherwise is to support the idea that the “fentanyl he had in his body” (which has been disputed) somehow magically killed him in the VERY INSTANT that he had a knee to his neck.

"Being outraged and angry, especially when validated by peers, feels good. It is dangerous for us to assume that it doesn't just because
feel-bad topics happen to be those under consideration when someone is outraged and angry. Outrage is a psychologically toxic thing which feels good and which can often hurt others when indulged. We should do everything we can to denormalize it because it hurts everyone involved! Teaching children that outrage is not only ok but good will cause them to seek it out, and outrage is an insidious thing which legitimizes itself under the guise of moral superiority and can become all-consuming. I think that the current American far right and far left are both founded on outrage, and that's very worrying to me. Their members may claim that they're in a fight for good and that they're making sacrifices, but I don't buy that at all. Outrage feels amazing to someone who is already hooked on it."

Idk why people don’t understand that eating issues are never the root of the problem. Like if someone is eating too much and gaining weight, it’s never gonna help to be like hey stop eating so much. People get so triggered by others overeating and think fat people just need a good lecture to bring them to their senses it’s so weird. The conversation with that persons roommate should not mention the eating at all and just be about their mental health, which is clearly the issue here."

The assigned readings are like 20 pages long and pretty unnecessary.

Jason will put like 10-15 graphs or figures up on a single slide to make a point that relates to one of them, max. He answers questions in the most roundabout way possible with complicated language - it really seems like he just likes hearing himself talk and appearing super smart. It's a completely ineffective style of teaching. Honestly the lectures by Dave and Sliman almost made it worse because they just made me yearn for better times in better courses.

"Let me be perfectly clear. The issue isn’t if YOU support lgbtq rights, it’s the company as a whole. Secondly, conversion therapy isn’t effective, it’s deeply traumatizing and damaging, and is still active today. Third, their views are not antiquated or dying out. Homophobia is still incredibly prevalent. I’m not going to judge you for eating at chick fil a cause that’s not my problem, but don’t pretend like the issues lgbtq people face are suddenly over. Don’t act like homophobia has suddenly disappeared."
"Hey, I dealt with this same problem before. I was going through a bad time my junior year of high school and spiraled into that afterlife tumble. It can be really scary and I want you to know you’re not alone. I spent a lot of time doing research on the afterlife and NDEs and stuff. I think it got better for me when I ultimately realized that no matter what I do, life still goes on and I have my unique place here in the universe that no one else can occupy. I think talking to an older person you trust like your mom and dad can really help as well since they can give you some perspective and good advice. Overall I want you to know that I care and I believe in you and that you’re not alone."
"So I'm seeing some UT hubbub about Into The Woods, and I think it's absolutely stupid - if the original director was that upset about someone ""stealing"" their show, they should've proposed it again when they could've. People were excited for Into The Woods to happen and it fucking sucked that it got cancelled. In fact, I'd say that it is inherently theatrical and lovely that the people who proposed it felt that the ""show must go on"" and made it happen and if it gets shot down because of some fake racism it'll be super upsetting."

"I have had the pleasure of having my first romantic relationship (both physically and emotionally) with another at UChicago over the past year, but I feel somewhat discontent. I have enjoyed my time together with this person and really enjoy their company, but I'm also still interested in having more sexual experiences with other people. I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit to something long term with my partner, but I also don't want to look back and completely regret choosing dating around in college over something that could've made me happy in the long term. Would it be reasonable for me to separate romantically with this person so that I can spend more time discovering myself sexually? Or would this be a dumb/shortsighted reason to give up what I currently have?"

I just finished my third year as a pre-med double major - I honestly thought premed STEM classes during COVID were much easier during remote learning than when they were in person. The curves seemed more generous and it was much easier to get the A’s/A-‘s you want to pad your GPA for the application cycle. Good luck though! The lack of cheating may be useful for some of the easier requirements like physics

"Here’s my conspiracy theory about grade/GPA discourse: it was deliberately manufactured by That Kids so they could gain a leg up by provoking anxiety in their classmates. Think about it. GPA discourse draws attention from people and makes many people feel insecure or nervous. The people posting about it don’t face any social repercussions because Secrets is anonymous. This is the perfect environment for an asshole desperate to bring down the curve in his business econ class.
Further evidence that GPA discourse is manufactured by That Kids:
1. There are no public statistics about the average GPA at UChicago
2. Only a That Kid would give enough of a shit about other people’s GPAs to talk about them in the first place
3. This school is full of fucking sociopaths"

"Ok not to be rude but have you maybe considered that conservatism—particularly the strain of so-called “conservatism” popular in the US now—is literally just wrong? Have you not noticed by now that the logical foundations of “conservatism” often rest on empty appeals to the nebulous concepts of “nature” and “God”? Like maybe while you’re here at UChicago take some time to examine your own beliefs and see whether they actually hold up under scrutiny.

Also, more directly relevant to your concerns about the treatment of conservatives on campus, have you taken into account the fact that the average article on *the* conservative campus publication, which is also the biggest conservative voice on campus, is about as intellectually stimulating as (though far less interesting than) a Buzzfeed listicle? Do you not think articles with titles like “I’m From Silicon Valley and I’m Here to Protect You From Unorthodox Speech” or “How Leftism Ruined ‘Stargirl’” give you a bit of a bad name?"

"I've heard Latinx brought up a lot, and from my time at uni which was fairly recent it seems like there's become a massive misunderstanding of the word and its use. It was created to be used for and by trans latin people and their friends so that they would have a gender-accurate way of referring to themselves as a member of the greater latin community. I do not personally think there was any attempt to make all Latin people use the term latinx, or to call out people who call themselves or others latino as ""unwoke."" That being said, I could totally see how the blue check dems on twitter probably took it and ran with it thinking that it was supposed to somehow replace latino/latina, and then subsequently castigated anyone who didn't use it."

Speech and Phenomena made very little sense to me, and when I moved on to Deleuze and Guattari it just got so much worse. Anti-Oedipus was fun to read at times, but at the end I felt like it said nothing of any philosophical substance, or else was so caught up in terminology and metaphor and pre-post-neo-analytico-psycho-hyphenization that it became completely unintelligible. Do I just need to keep digging? Am I missing something? I really would like to understand them, but good lord at this point I’m not even positive there’s something for me to understand."

At the same time, I kind of don't really think I'd be into software security as an end-goal? Like, the whole point of software security is to help maintain the status quo and make sure nothing happens, and it always presupposes some kind of adversary.

"most of the time when i have sex with men i feel so repulsed by them even if they are attractive and are nice and funny and all of that like i literally just feel so grossed out by them. literally anytime i hook up with a guy afterwards im like i just think i want to be friends. i think i’m gay.

- a woman who isn’t straight but continues to have sex with men because the thought of men finding her attractive makes her feel good about herself

note: i’ve made out with a lot of women and gone on dates with women but have not been in a relationship or had sex with a woman"

"Black male cops are allowed to be more human, more nuanced. But it's only because they're cops. Which is interesting in how it intersects not just with the relationship between the police and the Black community, but also the relationship between police and attaining whiteness. The reason you see so many cops both in media and irl with Irish and Italian ancestry, for instance, is that when those communities started trying to attain whiteness (they were not inherently afforded it at first), one of the avenues they pursued was becoming the backbone of the police force in many of their communities."

"I felt the same way you do. I’m bisexual, not gay, but I’m not attracted to many guys.
One day I had the epiphany that “I shouldn’t be cringing away when my date tries to kiss me and making excuses to not have sex; it doesn’t have to be this way” and ever since then I’ve only dated and slept with women and guys who I am attracted to, and my life has been so much better. The sooner you accept what you like and stop forcing yourself to endure what you don’t like, the happier you’ll be.

Go forth and be gay, friend."

"Disinterpretation is a concept we can use to highlight why we find debating with people we think ""live in a different reality"" so infuriating.

The idea is that when encountering an opinion, many people only pay attention up to the point where they can decide whether the opinion is from a friend or an enemy - the actual meaning of the opinion is almost totally irrelevant. Then people respond with intense emotion, based on their idea of that opinion (and what they percieve to be related talking points or rebuttals), often resulting in bitter attacks with no basis in reality."
"I usually forget and leave out the McNear portion of Herr Tucker Carlson's name because I've never had to eat a half frozen, half burnt, pseudo-chicken flavored, sawdust-textured, soylent McNear patty infused with 12 syllable or longer chemical compounds and the bitter tears of oppressed workers.

If the McNear family had found a way to package the combined existential crises of post divorce loneliness, the total lack of meaning in one's life, and the impending doom/release of death as something that is still legally definable as food and then packaged that with a side scoop of mostly cellulose bulking agent imitation mashed potatoes and sold it priced within reach of those toiling in poverty then I probably wouldn't forget it quite so much."
"I don't know if this is the right forum for this but last night my best friend (we're both girls, if that makes a difference, and we've been friends for 6ish years, very close for about 2) told me she's in love with me and has been since the start of this year. I had to tell her I don't see us as anything more than a very close friendship. We hold hands and hug, but she does this with other friends, and beyond that we've never done anything that isn't strictly platonic. I don't know yet if I'm bi or straight, but I am 100% confident I don't want to date her, purely because I don't want to date my best friend.

But I adore her to pieces. I talk to her everyday and I tell her everything. She's the first friend I've had that has made me feel wanted and respected in a friendship and I can't bear to lose this. She told me she doesn't want to lose it either and will work on moving on, but I don't know. I'm not sure how to handle this. Does anyone know what I can do?"

"Dave Filoni bothers me. I’m fine with talentless hacks having fun in a selfindulgent nerdfest. What really bothers me is the amount of importance the Star Wars fandom puts on such an obviously untalented creator. People pretend he is some sort of paragon of creativity and intellectual originality. No. Wake up. He is not doing anything more significant than those weirdos on Tumblr obsessed with Supernatural who create OCs and self-inserts in their bizarro fanfictions.

When you are a member of the organization that created the Disney Trilogy and eradicated 40 years of Legends content, when that organization is currently celebrating the Bad Batch, a show that purports to engage the entire fandom while making 10 mediocre episodes and a finale that is obvious Sequel apologia, you have an obligation to create Star Wars content that is meaningful and relevant. Lucasfilm not only is an Ivory Tower and a wretched hive of scum and villainy; it celebrates being one. There is a reason their projects make so much money yet very little relevance amongst the fanbase.

You want to do something creative? While I was reading Heir to the Empire I met Jorus C’baoth, a character that had incredible depth, insightful commentary on the state of the Galaxy, and thoughtful creativity. Ahsoka falls far short of that standard. Start there. Instead of bashing Legends for being convoluted or inane, why don’t you realize that you need some actual effort and thought from real fans, people who understand Star Wars with more breadth and nuance?

You want to do something remarkable? Why not start some conversations about how Ahsoka has the most plot armor out of any Star Wars character, instead of indulging yourselves in weird fangirling for a deluded fanboy’s OC? You bash Legends for power scaling, and you think Rebels is oh-so-profound because of a family dynamic and the Bendu, but the average quality of rumination on the Force, world-building, and care taken for lore consistency is far lower than that in Legends, in both the canon novels and shows. Canon doesn’t exist in an abstraction. Canon is rigid and fits neatly into boxes, where things happen or they don’t. Retconning the Kanan comic in the Bad Batch season opener is not helpful.

So I guess the real reason Dave Filoni bothers me so much is that he’s emblematic whole the self-indulgent, self-congratulating Lucasfilm culture that is completely unaware of its incompetence and so detached from its fanbase. It has been given an IP and budget that many artists and fans can only dream of having. There are so many talented creators I have met at DragonCon that would probably look at his creations and see the same thing we see when we look at the last season of Game of Thrones -- an immense waste of talent and money.

When I speak to Star Wars fans, I often talk about the kind of love for the franchise that is possible only because you are surrounded by passionate individuals and we will give each other the support to create cool stuff -- fan games, art, fan films, song remixes, special edition edits, etc etc. A few months ago, an elderly, tired-looking woman raised her hand and asked me why I was talking about fans having fun and creating and reading Legends content instead of simply consuming content. I told her that the attention to detail in Legends is top-notch, but that’s just a given -- it’s a baseline on which we build more multifaceted, impactful interactions with Star Wars. I told her it’s not a waste of time, because think about it: if we want to retcon the Disney trilogy, do we want the aftermath to be designed by a man who invented literal space portals to save his OC, or do you want someone who did write fanfiction but also memorized the names of the Trade Federation’s leadership? I cannot say the same thing about Lucasfilm; they do in fact waste ridiculous amounts of time and resources doing crap like the Bad Batch and meaningless comic arcs that don’t involve respect for the canon and the characters. I told the lady that if you want to focus solely on making money, you should continue to produce, Mrs. Kennedy.

People criticize the community for the amounts of toxicity, anti-Disney sentiment, and general distaste for Lucasfilm. But I’ve seen a surprising number of people use those viewpoints as opportunities to learn more about the problems with Star Wars so they can create their own Star Wars content or do more impactful stuff in the film/print industry, and the Reddit comments in r/SaltierThanCrait back me up. There is a reason Star Wars fans become writers, directors, and politicians; and it is not just because of pedigree and toxicity.

I am not saying Star Wars fans are altruistic world-changers. They are toxic, often bigoted people who seek to tear others down and bullshit about retcons while comfortably residing in their moms’ basements. But at least they have those retcons. At least they want to make some sort of impact, and at least they pretend to care about Star Wars while pursuing their own successes. When have filmmakers ever changed Star Wars (outside of George Lucas) by purely focusing on making money? For all the ridiculous bullshit Dave Filoni has come up with, why is Luuke still less cringe inducing than the Purgill? How many respectful approaches to canon do we ever see coming out of Lucasfilm? This place has talent and resources. Why are they wasting them on Cobb Vanth when they can use that time to do much more meaningful things? Why is Dave Filoni ignoring his social responsibility?"

So now I'm going into third year with no experience and somewhat behind in my major. I feel like taking a gap year to reset, work on skills, and get work experience would be really beneficial, but I'm a little worried about losing contact with all of my friends and whether a gap year would even be that beneficial.

The closest thing we have ever had to a lockdown is ""don't leave home for non-essential reasons"" in a select few left-leaning states, which is just as unenforceable as any restriction since then.

 @the commenter, they aren’t wrong though. It’s an amazing purpose but I’m not sure if there’s anything in place to stop a rapist from fabricating some story out of retaliation. They clearly aren’t morally above anything. While awareness should obviously be spread, and victims shouldn’t have to verify their assault, I do worry about it ending up akin to the Salem witch trials etc, where anyone can accuse anyone and they’re judged as guilty automatically. The only thing worse than victims feeling like they aren’t believed or that they need evidence are victims accused of rape because they had the courage to post to the page knowing their rapist would know it’s them, and their rapist being believed, and there should be some sort of measure against that"
"That I have survived abuse of various kinds, have faced near-death from both accidental circumstance and violence (different as the particulars of these may be from those around me) is not a card to play in gamified social interaction or a weapon to wield in battles over prestige.

I’d rather a more thorough, albeit longer legal process than a lynch mob. If the legal system isn’t robust enough, fight to change that. Don’t undermine the presumption of innocence. I know this isn’t technically a criminal proceeding so it’s held to different standards. But if the presumption of innocence is ultimately good, it shouldn’t matter whether it’s legally applicable."

In the studies I'm citing, false accusations are considered those that are provably false, as in they are known not to happen. Baseless is considered cases where evidence cannot be found so it is impossible to determine.

A study of 136 sexual assault cases in Boston from 1998-2007 found a 5.9 percent rate of false reports (Lisak et al., 2010).

Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, researchers studied 812 reports of sexual assault from 2000-2003 and found a 2.1 percent rate of false reports (Heenan & Murray 2006)

Reports also show that false reporting is higher in college communities and to services that aren't formal legal services (title ix). I am sure they are even higher on sites that offer no accountability for falsely accusing others.

I am not saying that we shouldn't believe victims, we should, but we shouldn't jump to actions that could destroy someone's life when there is a significant chance that someone could make up such a horrible event to damage someone they hate. It's horrible that that even happens, but it does. I wish it didn't, but every piece of evidence suggests that it does."

“But it’s black and brown people’s fault that this country isn’t vaccinated”
"This talk about “due process” is completely misplaced. In a law court or a court that mimics a law court (like a Title IX court), no one can be convicted unless it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt, usually with forensic rather than merely circumstantial evidence, that they are guilty. This means that people who we all know have committed crimes often go free because there is little or no admissible evidence to convict them. This is as it should be.

However, people do not, have never, and rationally speaking should not refrain from forming opinions about other people (or expressing these opinions) until these people have been convicted of crimes in a court of law. That would be absurd (and potentially dangerous!), and it’s not how we operate. If multiple people told you that someone you know had smashed a window at a party last weekend, you wouldn’t think “I will not believe anything one way or another unless the party’s host presses charges and the alleged perpetrator is convicted”—of course not! You’d probably think “well, it’s technically possible that this could be a weird fabricated rumor, but it seems pretty likely that the person probably did it.”

Of course we should not immediately believe everything that we hear about other people, and we should always be open to changing our minds if new evidence comes out, but asking people follow legal rules of due process in their own minds is totally inappropriate and absurd. Rules of “due process” were developed for law courts, not for decision-making in our personal lives."

If you see/hear something, say something. Even the middle-school-esque ""Hey man, that's not cool"" is better than being a spineless coward who permits casual misogyny and serious crimes alike.

"#uchicagosecrets42855

honestly, completely agreed. it's getting aggravating how much non-scholarshipped people shit on going to this school while actively having chosen to come here and are still paying $80k a year to stay. like, if you don't like it here, you're really only staying bc it's the highest ranking university you got accepted into. i have no sympathy for that. if it's really just this awful, leave, transfer, idk, do something. there are so many people who would kill to have an acceptance here.

and no, this isn't saying you can't have qualms with the uni. i am very grateful to be here and still have my fair share of complaints. but this whole mentality of ""uchicago just sucks, i don't want to be here"" is so toxic, and for what? you don't have to be here, but the truth is that you're staying bc your ego can't handle going anywhere that ""ranks lower"", as if that even matters"

I would even argue that this round of mods is much better about what’s being posted for than 2/3 years ago when the rules over what qualified someone’s name to be eligible in a secrets post was waaaaay looser.

2. If you’re wondering why people got so mad at the reply people who are constantly commenting it’s the Dunner-Kruger effect. If you think you have a good and relevant response to all or even most of the questions on Secrets you’re wrong. This especially goes for underclassmen trying to make definitive statement about UChicago.
Now if you’re shit posting in the comments on purpose then pop-off king, but don’t be surprised if people react poorly to posts that are intentional meant to annoy them.

"Vaush has a very serious ego problem. He never admits with even a hint of humility that he was initially wrong about the definition of Black Nationalism—he skips right to indignation at the very idea that somebody might not realize that he's since changed his position. So he technically acknowledges the fact that he fucked up but minimizes the nature of the error as much as possible and puts the onus back on anybody who hasn't ""caught up.""

I think a person operating in better faith would approach this fundamentally differently. Something like, ""yeah, I was totally wrong at the beginning of that debate, and it's a shame that this clip keeps circulating, but at least I've corrected myself since then."" I dunno, something at least approaching a more apologetic tone. You gotta accept when you fucked up and own it. The problem is that this is optically ""weaker"" than immediately putting your ""opponent"" back on the defensive while ""refuting"" their claim.

That's the biggest issue with online debate culture, really. ""Looking"" right is not the same thing as being right, but people like Vaush often excel with the former at the expense of the latter, and ""winning"" debates can become this constantly self-reinforcing, subconcious process of confirmation bias. I've personally had my perspective shifted by religious/political debates in the past but the kinds of people who are convinced simply because a debater has the appearance of being an authority on a topic were probably not convinced for very good reasons.

There's a less charitable reading of all this which is that Vaush is just a financially-motivated bad actor at this point, but I can't know what's going on in his head. All I know is that I used to enjoy some of his content, and still think he is an effective communicator and skilled rhetorician, but I've found most of his stuff unwatchable recently, largely due to his overwhelming sense of self-importance and total lack of humility (which has clearly, as you have pointed out here, cultivated a pretty toxic fanbase). For a dude who talks about how much ""the left"" hates him, he sure seems to hate a lot of people on the left.

The last thing I'll say is that I do think that all of this ego-centering, hyper-individualistic inability to admit when you're wrong is as much an inevitable outcome of the world we live in (i.e. capitalism et al.) as it is a character flaw for specific people to work on as needed. Most of us are socialized as children into believing some version of ""great man theory"" and into seeing it as weak to admit you're wrong or be persuaded by an opposing viewpoint. Internalizing that stigma makes it hard to do ourselves. Anybody acting in good faith should be encouraged to overcome that stigma, but digging your heels in is arguably the more predictable response.

But maybe I'm striving for more understanding than is deserved."

I’m usually not shy about replying under my own name, but the deluge of “go fuck yourselves” that came off this comment made me scared to post publicly. I do agree that anorexia is an issue. I have experienced and am still experiencing issues relating to starvation and food control. However, it really is important to decouple obesity and body positivity in this country. It is impossible to carry around a certain amount of excess weight and still be healthy. That said, I have seen beauty at all places on the weight scale. Everybody needs to take a breath, do some serious research, talk to their doctor, and either gain, lose, or maintain according to their height, muscle mass, and intended lifestyle without being influenced by online personas who diss either losing or gaining weight. One person can and should be proud of losing 30 lbs; another of gaining that much.

But for heaven’s sake, don’t let your first instinct on hearing someone’s opinion be “go fuck yourself.” Let it be, “I disagree. Why do you think that?” Let’s work together against the problem, not separately against each other."

also, more fiber would probably help. i've been increasing fiber intake steadily and it's certainly getting there.

On that topic, I wish I could go back to the girl in the sixth grade who thought her thighs were a bit too large (they weren't- I was perfectly healthy but I didn't have a thigh gap) and then started to dive deep in whatever diets I could find. In the years since, I've definitely had both restrictive eating habits and bulimia. I'm proud that I'm doing better but I have not had a single meal since where I didn't mentally count the calories or think if I moved enough that day to permit myself the to eat a certain thing. Even though I've been eating healthily for the past couple months (about a year at this point) its been a huge effort to prevent myself from both restricting and bingeing. Honestly, I'm so tired of thinking about it. My whole day revolves around making sure I can eat at the right times because otherwise, I get anxious and its harder for me to eat correctly."

The debates in previous comment sections on if we should care more about obesity vs anorexia as a society was just dangerously uninformed. A group of commenters claimed that 1) obesity is not correlated to health, & 2) anorexia is a far bigger societal issue than obesity. Reality check: 10,200 people very sadly loose their lives every year to anorexia. 300,000 people very sadly loose their lives every year to obesity.

Yes, obviously anorexia is tragic and I have a huge amount of sympathy for people suffering with its burden-which I can’t imagine the full impact of. But (if we want to continue the rather childish insistence of ‘ranking’ issues) obesity is still the most important ‘nutrition’ issue (being much more widespread), and those claiming it has no correlation to health are deluded. It obviously does. We should be concerned about both under and overweight populations in this country, rather than peddling untruths to avoid an honest contemporary conversation about food consumption in America today."

"OMG ABSOLUTE SEXY HEALTHY ICONNNN

"Reading over the housing discipline policy… it says we can have a maximum of 3 people in a single or 5 people in a double at once, and that parties, registered or unregistered, are not allowed? Please tell me nobody is planning on actually following this… I don’t want my second year fucking ruined too."
"There is a social cost to obesity. It's not ""just"" your body. You incur more healthcare costs over your life. An obese society at the macroscopic level is transferring wealth from healthcare to the food industry. But that means obesity is not ""just"" a personal problem too. It's also a social problem. We need sugar taxes and regulation on school lunches. The current equilibrium is definitely not optimal for consumer welfare."
does anyone have experience taking a 4 class schedule with classes that only meet M/W/F? is it horrible?

"After 20 years, this is how we should memorialize 9/11. Clearly, the same people going over the top with “never forget” don’t actually give a shit about Americans dying, or they would stop supporting anti-vaxxers, racist police officers, and the Republicans who enable them. “Never forget” is nothing more than propaganda to justify US imperialism"
"9/11 memorials should be about remembering and honoring those who died and whose lives were changed forever on that day. We’re not honoring George Bush, or American foreign policy, or people who use 9/11 as an excuse to justify their bigotry. Don’t use others’ disregard of the actual occasion to excuse your own disrespect."

"There’s a ton of different stuff being said about losing weight/exercise/dieting, and idk the genders of the people who are posting stuff anonymously, but it’s kinda disheartening to see so many dudes in the comments acting like exercise and weight loss is as simple as a calorie deficit plus an exercise routine. As a female runner, I learned how important it was to maintain a decent amount of body fat. Women and men have very different needs when it comes to exercise and eating because women require more body fat to keep healthy estrogen levels. To women out there who are trying to achieve a certain body type, a really important indicator of health is your period. If you are missing your period— talk to a doctor and make sure you’re not over exercising or under-eating. Building muscle is great but with that also comes maintaining and sometimes gaining body fat along with it!"
where did the uchicago share your story insta page go??? that was a valuable resource/outlet and I wanted to share smth for support and now I can't
Is it true that the IOP has invited Nick Fuentes to speak at the IOP?
"as a formerly obese person, it never ceases to amaze me how dangerous and ignorant the approaches of modern “fat acceptance” activists are. it’s literally comparable to telling alcoholics to keep drinking or a schizophrenic that their hallucinations are real. i am 100% sympathetic towards the difficulty of the process involved (from firsthand experience), but facts are facts at the end of the day. my scale doesn’t lie to me. my blood pressure and my heart health don’t lie to me. i have multiple relatives with type 2 diabetes as a result of over-consuming sugar and fatty foods. diabetes doesn’t lie to you. i know this is super harsh but those people who are “fat acceptance” activists better also accept the medical risks they take alongside it. all it takes is a quick google search: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5401682/"

"The truly stupid thing about the university banning dorm parties is that it will simply force underclassmen to go to frats. The entire point of allowing parties registered with RHs in the first place was to provide a space with some minimum supervision to hopefully prevent sexual assault/alcohol overdose. Now, completely unregulated frats will become the party scene."

But the lease is a year long and I don't have anywhere else I could live / afford to live. Should I just keep dating her for the year? I think I could be fairly content pretending with her for a year but also I don't want to lead her on because I do care about her. ugh why the fuck did i sign this lease"

The flip flop on Frontline Books was SOOOOOO quick LMAO
"I'm confused. it sounds from the guidelines that students are in fact allowed to be in residence halls that they don't live in. On the housing guidelines page it says, ""The only guests that will be admitted or allowed into the residence halls at any time during the 2021- 2022 academic year are resident students who live in another residence hall on campus. "" that means students can have guests as long as they're also uchicago students. Isn't this at least an improvement? Am I misreading something? Why are there all these posts about ""no visitors allowed?"" can someone clear this up once and for all?"
why are y'all saying visitation is limited? doesn't it say visitors from other resident halls are allowed?

"Honest question, which will be especially important this year:

If two people were both drinking heavily, obviously neither can give full consent. But if one person doesn’t know that the other person was drunk, and can’t remember that they gave consent (because they were drunk and weren’t sure what they said), there would be reason for them to question if they were assaulted, which is completely justifiable.

But if the other person was also at the same level of intoxication, they would have also been taken advantage of.

So how can situations like these be avoided when people go to these parties and drink and want to hook up?

Should both members sign a contract or something?

Just a serious question because this stuff is important."

"I know this is bait, but…even if you are one of these “your value is determined by how much money you make for your company’s shareholders” people, you should still see academic philosophers as valuable. Sure, universities are non-profits and have endowments, but they still require yearly income to survive, and their income depends in large part on the quality of their faculty. You chose to go to this expensive university, so you clearly think that there’s something worthwhile about what you’re getting here, so you presumably think that ensuring the survival of the University is a worthy goal even though it doesn’t generate a profit. Philosophy faculty are actively contributing to this goal (we all know how academic hiring works—if they didn’t contribute to this goal, they wouldn’t be hired).

Tarantino is a shitty and overrated director. Pulp Fiction isn’t good. It’s just a racist movie that white boys like because it has a lot of gore and they get to imagine an alternate universe where it’s acceptable for them to use the n-word. There is nothing deeper or thought-provoking beneath the surface. That is literally all it is. Tarantino uses his “the movie is in several parts… it skips in time” gimmick to make it seem like he’s doing something new or innovative, but he really isn’t. At the end of the day, it’s yet another violent, hyper-masculine movie– it just doesn’t fully make sense until the end. If it weren’t for this “several parts” gimmick, everyone would realize that this film has no value whatsoever outside of gory spectatorship that entertains frat boys"

"[0] Intro

Hi, this is Hax from the Melee community. I am writing this report in order to alert not only the Melee
community, but also other surrounding esports communities about an incredibly dangerous pattern of
behavior that the Melee community is currently following. From the outside, it may seem that all is
good and well in the Melee community, but that isn’t the case. The truth is that my entire community
has been subjugated by a certain threat over the years, and it doesn’t seem that anyone else sees what I
see anymore. If they do, then they are either too paralyzed with fear to make an impact, or they lack the
platform to do so. With that being said, I ask that you please take the contents of this report seriously,
as there is a lot on the line.

The revised version of the Metagame documentary that is set to air this weekend.

At first, I didn’t want to give the esports world the red pill on what was really going on within the
Melee community. I saw that people were living happily in ignorance, and I didn’t want to change that.
But it seems that every year that goes by, the situation only gets worse. What drew the line for me was
when the filmmaker Samox recently announced that he’d be releasing an edited version of the
Metagame documentary, which is set to air this weekend. I’m eventually going to explain why it
should actually be illegal for this documentary to air, and why the Melee community needs to wake
up to what’s going on.

For those who don’t know me, let me introduce myself and explain why you should trust the contents
of this document. I’ve been in the Melee community for 16 years, having been a top player for many of
those years. Throughout my career, I’ve proven myself to be not only a top player, but also a top
influencer for the community. Although I only have a moderate following, I’ve helped the Melee scene
make technological progress in at least 5 major ways. The most notable thing I’ve done is create an
ergonomic controller called the BOXX, which thousands of Melee players now use in order to avoid
injuring their hands and wrists, but I’ve also done several other things. In 2017, I advocated for in-
game software mods that gave quality-of-life improvements to Gamecube controller users. These were
adopted later that year. Then, in 2019, I explained why Melee needed an anti-stalling rule called a ledge
grab limit. This rule set change was approved shortly afterward as well. Later in 2019, I started hosting
a weekly tournament series called Hax’s Nightclub which showed people that it was viable to play
Melee on LCD monitors. Through the use of the latest technology, my tournament series gave people a
glimpse at what Melee might look like in the future. And finally, starting in 2020, I began making
educational videos that taught people about intricate Melee mechanics. All of my videos went into great
detail about mechanics that people had never heard of before, and were fact-checked several times for
accuracy.

Something to know about all of the innovations I just described is that they all went against the grain.
These were all radical ideas at first, but I helped show that they were the right directions for the
community to go in. The contents of this report will go against the grain as well. However, this report
will have to do with politics rather than technology. People may not realize this, but the Melee
community’s politics are in shambles right now. There is something unthinkably evil going on in front
of our eyes within the Melee community, and I have the evidence to prove it. This report will be tough
to stomach, but the longer the community remains ignorant, the worse the situation will get, and so we
don’t have a choice anymore.

“The greater the crime perpetrated by the leadership, the less likely the people will ever believe their
leaders capable of perpetrating such an event.” - Adolf Hitler

The most difficult part about this document will be accepting that the evil I’m referring to is being
perpetrated by a community leader. There is a community leader who has caused this community to be
filled with hatred, corruption, and greed, which are all things that the Smash community once didn’t
have. These things have become so normalized that the current generation of players doesn’t even seem
to realize what’s going on, and that things weren’t this way before. People are genuinely clueless that
darkness has been cast over the entire Smash community, but hopefully this document will change that.

Before I go any further, let me be clear about the magnitude of this report. This report is the final line
of defense against someone who will continue to threaten the well-being of the Smash community,
as well as surrounding esports communities if he isn’t stopped. The situation will endlessly get worse,
to the point that it’11 become comparable to a reign of terror within esports. I know this to be true based
on three factors. The first one is psychology. I’ve studied psychology extensively in order to bring you
this document, and I know exactly what type of cloth this person is cut from. I’ll be explaining what
constitutes a supremely evil person, as well as how to spot one. I’|l also be going over proven strategies
for manipulating people — especially large crowds of people — that have been used on several occasions.
While it is bad that I’ll be showing you how to manipulate people, it’s worse for you not to know how
the Smash community has repeatedly been manipulated. Finally, I'll be explaining how people with
these personality traits view their so-called “fans and supporters,” and even some of the people who
think that they are their friends.

The next factor is history. I’ve been studying history so that I can show you that what is happening
within the Smash community is 1:1 with what happened in societies that collapsed. We are setting
ourselves up for a dystopia in more ways than people know, and an entire culture shift is going to be
necessary to fix things.

Finally, I will piece everything together with classified information that nobody else has access to.
Most importantly, you need to know the truth about Evidence.zip, which is a collection of documents
that was put together 8 years ago. Evidence.zip is the red pill because it reveals an M.O. that hasn’t
changed, and has only evolved as time has gone on. The press has continuously lied to you about
Evidence.zip, and so you’|l need to drop everything you currently know about it. Evidence.zip will
reveal that several events that have occurred in recent years were politically motivated in ways that the
Smash community didn’t realize, and that there was an agenda in motion the entire time.

I will also be backing everything up with my own personal experiences. I’ve been withholding a ton of
information for this inevitable moment, and it’s time to release all of it. Something I want to apologize
in advance for is the fact that I am going to betray several people’s trust in me in order to bring you the
full truth today. Private information must be leaked in order to tell the full story, and so I’m sorry to
everyone who that affects.

One last thing I want to go over is why I believe this is a groundbreaking document. This document is a
case study for how a community can be uprooted without even realizing it. It will show how platforms
such as Twitter, Twitch, and YouTube can be weaponized in the modern-day era of social media, and
how laws should be implemented to ban certain strategies when it comes to these platforms. Similarly,
this document will show how we, as a society, underestimate the impact of political and psychological
crimes, and how we can’t underestimate crimes that affect socioeconomics and people’s mental health.
It will also show how the esports universe provides the perfect platform for criminology; by constantly
using the excuse that someone is a ‘heel,’ they become able to exploit their community endlessly
without ever being held accountable. All of these things are injustices that call for reform.

Most notably, this document calls for an entire community to undo its way of thinking. There is a cult
of personality that needs to be broken up within the Smash community, and I have a feeling it will be
after people find out what they’ve become a part of.

This is a story of political and psychological warfare that took place in front of your very eyes over the

course of the past decade. As the only person in the entire world capable of telling you this story, I
know that I must do so, as it has the potential to change the timeline we live in.

“This just in: Leffen tweets bad about Ultimate
Tomorrow: people taking Leffen’s word on Ultimate as law

More at 11”

-ESAM (August 24"", 2019)

2 years ago, ESAM emerged as a whistle-blower who stated that he was tired of Leffen shaping the
discourse wherever he went within the Smash community, and having people blindly follow him as
well. ESAM’s posts did incredibly well on Twitter and Reddit. They were clearly representative of

something that lots of people had felt, but may not have had the platform or the courage to express.

For those who don’t know, ESAM is an Ultimate player with about 150,000 followers nowadays,
making him a notable influencer. Meanwhile, Leffen is a Melee player with about 300,000 followers,
making him the current biggest influencer in the Smash community. Leffen’s influence is the biggest
when you consider not only his follower count, but also the credibility that has been assigned to him. It
seems that whenever Leffen speaks, his opinions are regarded as factual, which is what led to ESAM’s
frustrations."

"so I had a really hard time making friends last year, and then in winter quarter a group of girls kind of took me in. They were all already super close and I felt and still sometimes feel a little awkward, but they invited me to stuff and vice versa, and its been nice so far. Today I found out that they're all going out together, specifically and solely without me. Which is fine, no big. I just feel like shit because it's like. What did I do to upset them? Why can't I ever find a group???? I'm a second year and it feels like everyone slotted into place last year, and I'm still having awkward half-conversations with people who couldn't care less."

The most tangible, ambitious thing that seems pretty common here is wanting to go into academia and pursue a doctoral degree, or go into politics. I guess I was expecting UChicago to have at least a good amount of aspiring technocrats and whatnot. Maybe we lost them all to Stanford and Harvard."

"All that matters here is your happiness, and that of your gf. It doesn't matter if others might see you as the bad guy or whatever; you have to do what's best for the both of you. It's time to have a frank convo with your gf and figure out if she's fallen out of love with you, or if there's just some other factor that prevents her from reaching out as much (business, anxiety, etc.) You're doing yourself no favors by staying with her if she's not in love with you anymore. I know it hurts and it will still hurt for a while, but people's feelings come and go, and you cannot fault her or yourself for that. You will find new love, if this one is now over.

I am literally one of those kids who is making medical school their entire life rn. I wasn't like this at all until I started applying and now I can't stop thinking about it and freaking out. I wake up every morning and check my email and I don't see interview invitations and I immediately feel like I'm going to throw up. I cry like 4-5 times a week about medical school admissions. Every time I see one of those stupid BeMo ads about interviews I get nauseous. Like I know it isn't the end of the world if I don't get into medical school and I know we're still early in the interview season and I know that I had at least solid preparation for this admissions season and there's no reason why I'd believe I'd get rejected everywhere and there's no reason for me to be freaking out but I literally cannot stop panicking like I'm partially convinced I'm going to end up homeless at this point and I know this is almost comical the way I'm writing this but I genuinely unironically think I'm going to end up a failure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer and are even more stressed about admissions than I am and the thought of having to tell them I wasn't admitted anywhere genuinely makes me feel like my lungs are going to give out on me and like I'm goign to have a heart attack. I have no idea why I am venting about this to Uchicago Secrets of all places but I feel so bad for panicking to my friends for nearly no reason and I need someone to like bully me or something so I realize just how stupid I'm being please help i don't like crying myself to sleep this often

Why tf do u keep going to du if u get sketchy vibes then lmao
"It’s completely reasonable that there be separate places for grad students to work. There are plenty of places where undergraduates can study. Undergraduates are not entitled to go everywhere. Booth is separate from the college, and it makes sense that the conference rooms and other spaces in Booth be reserved for Booth students. It would be incredibly annoying for Booth students if undergrads took over Booth study space and made it harder for actual Booth students to get conference rooms that they need to work."

I’m colorblind and without even asking, she started describing the colors of the fish that I had trouble differentiating. Like second nature, she went out of her way to share something beautiful with me. It’s not like being colorblind is even a big deal or significant disability day-to-day, and I never would have asked someone to describe colors to me like that but she did the little extra thing to make me feel loved and I was straight up SOBBING looking at these fish. She genuinely makes me feel like the luckiest person alive. Even years into our relationship I’m still falling in love with her. I simply can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with her."

"I’m seeing so much stress / anxiety / angst on this page recently. As someone who recently dropped out (involuntary leave of absence 😉) here are my 2 cents~ When I first came to this school, it felt like it was the key to the rest of my life. As a FGLI it felt like it was the opportunity of a lifetime, and for many of us it can be. For me, life’s worst case scenario became doing poorly in a class. And then it was academic probation. And then suspension. All of those things happened to me and I felt like the rest of my life was fucked. However, once I was out of this environment my perspective changed. I realized UChicago isn’t everything— it’s actually insignificant compared to the rest of the world. I discovered that I’ve been able to rely on my own skill and intelligence to find success [for the m*n out there rolling their eyes, I’ve come to own a bunch of equity in one of my states most profitable startups & am on track to becoming a successful entrepreneur in the cannabis industry as a BIPOC woman. I’m also working a min wage job, which I find very rewarding]. I’ve been through many of our collective “worst case” scenarios and I’ve been able to adapt to it and come out ok. I’ve met all of y’all and I’m confident in your ability to do adapt to whatever is thrown your way. Shit happens, UChicago does not equal life. It’s just a sadistic environment that has convinced us all we need it to become ~*great*~, which is a marketing strategy in the end. TLDR; you got this. You’ll figure it out. This school doesn’t change who you are."

i've got some money through parents (weekly allowance) and I don't know on what can I spend it. I am planning on not showering today because I showered twice yesterday.

I have no plans on going outside nor doing anything physical this weekend. I washed my face and put on new clothes, and my last midterm was today. What I am wondering do I have to worry about anything else? I'm not going to be insanely dirty for not showering for one full day, right? Do you have any ideas on what to do with my allowance?"

"I didn't want to have to say this but I feel like I'm morally obligated to. I don't want there to be yet another generation of elite college graduates fucking up the world with their misguided senses of ""doing the right thing"" while being completely oblivious to what actually matters.

The ""sch"" in ""bruschetta"" is pronounced ""sk"" and not ""sh"".

Yeah, I said it. It might be tough to hear, you might not even believe me, but this is the truth, whether you like it or not.

I'm pretty sure the reason people pronounce it incorrectly is because they're more familiar with the German trigraph SCH which is pronounced like the English digraph SH. But bruschetta is an Italian word, and in Italian, that's not how it works. In Italian, the letter C can be pronounced two ways: there's the ""hard C"" before the letters A, O, and U, and there's ""soft C"" before I and E. Hard C is pronounced like the English letter K while soft C is pronounced like the English digraph CH. However, there are some cases where you want a hard C sound before an E or an I. In these cases, you append an H after the C. So, the digraph CH, in Italian, is actually pronounced like a hard C, or an English K, in all circumstances. For some more familiar examples, there's ""porCHEtta"", ""gnocCHI"", ""orecCHIette"", or ""macCHEroni"" So the S in ""bruschetta"" is pronounced like S is normally pronounced, and the CH is pronounced like a K. So if I were to convert it to English spelling conventions, it would be pronounced ""broosketta,"" and *not* ""brooshetta"".

(as an aside, if you want to do the opposite and put a soft C in front of an A/O/U, you add an I after the C. So for example, ""ciao"" is pronounced ""chow"" and not ""chyow"". This rule isn't quite as hard-and-fast as the CH rule though, but unless you're actually learning Italian it doesn't really matter. Also, all of the above applies to the letter G as well. A ""funghi"" pizza is pronounced similarly to the English ""fungi,"" while ""giardinera"" is pronounced ""jardinera"" and not ""jiardinera"".)"

"So guys, I have a problem. I’ve been a bad, bad girl. How, might you ask? Well, do I have the story for you. It all started on a cool fall morning at the University of Chicago a few weeks after O-Week. That’s when I saw him. Tall, with pools of ocean blue for eyes. The sexiest smile I’d ever seen. Abs so sculpted I could see even through his shirt. We had an instant connection. Too bad that’s when she saw him too. My best friend, and now, my enemy.

They started dating a few weeks after we met him. Obviously, she struck first. I, however, would get the last laugh. It all started in Ex-Libris when I bought a glazed donut. I went back from the counter to sit with him and her, eating my donut. I said it was snack time, but it wasn’t the donut I was hungry for.

I ate my glazed donut seductively, looking at him, locking my chocolate brown eyes with his blue. He blushed and looked down. My best friend? Doing a p-set.

Later that night, I received it. A snap. From him. It was smooth and brown, just like my donut.

It couldn’t be.

But it was.

Or should I say “butt” it was.

He sent me a picture of his butthole. His glory.

"MANGA REVIEW

Due to the OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE reception of my ANIME REVIEW, I present to you my MANGA REVIEW. Note I am not an EXPERT in manga as I am in anime, but I still wanted to find some time to discuss them.

Winner: Three Days of Happiness
Runner-up: GTO
Good: Solo Leveling,
Decent: Bloom into You, Mushoku Tensei
Meh: Domestic Girlfriend, Bastard, Grand Blue (longest blue balls personal record)
Bad: Horimiya (dropped), Oyasumi Punpun (dropped), Spy x Family, The Flowers of Evil.

Not sure how to feel about Solo Leveling and its popularity. A well-executed power-fantasy with very bland characters and little substance? Still fun to read. Thoughts?

Anticipate a HENTAI REVIEW next.

Address comments on the ANIME REVIEW:
- Actually haven't fully watched several of them, sorry.
- Re:Zero is trash, but has redeeming themes.
- Steins: Gate only second half is good, first half is awful.
- Kill la Kill deserves to be much lower.
- SNAFU deserves to be lower.
- Azumanga Daioh deserves to be higher.
- Decent (i.e. Black Lagoon) is still recommended, but less so.
- Mob (from only first episode, I know it's not a good sample size) is a worse OPM.

"As someone with GAD, I've been realizing that way we come off can be so intense. I've been having issues with my coworker because she's always making mean comments, being openly judgemental about the people around us (probs about me behind my back), being super negative, and constantly criticizing my work. Being around her has been such an unpleasant experience. She recently told me that she has GAD and it adds up, I'm now able to understand her behavior as a reflection of her symptoms. It doesn't change the fact that I hate working with her because being around her is pain, and I've become more self-critical of how I've acted the same way. I'm also retrospectively realizing that I've had falling outs with other anxiety folks for similar behavior. Go get treatment bbs! When our symptoms become maladaptive it negatively impacts both ourselves and the people around us."

"Administrators and professors need to recognize that after a day like yesterday( gun violence, a student killed, and a bomb threat)the student body is affected.

Also so what that he was a recent graduate not a current student? He still was a part of the community lived here in this neighborhood, and the fact that this could happen to him two blocks away from campus means it could happen to any of us possibly even on campus.

"Enough with this only “on campus” shit. So many members of the school live off-campus, and everything that happened yesterday affect all of them who are simply trying to go to class. Only having a UCPD presence on campus doesn’t do shit, not if there is a single person who has a need to venture off campus.

"HENTAI REVIEW

Hentai is bad. Monstrously bad. I have to admit that when consuming it it is difficult to be in a coherent state of mind. Still, I'd like to share with you some interesting didactic examples I've put together. These examples aren't rigorous nor exhaustive--in fact, I don't have any serious research into the genre.

Funniest: Tropical Kiss 1 (+ Mankitsu Happening)
Most shocking: Euphoria
Hentai where middle-aged man goads schoolgirls into fornication for a ""noble"" cause (yuck, stop recommending this to me): everything made by nur
Landlord is a horny (?) loli (just why?): Dokidoki Little Ooyasan
Coolest plot setup: Any plot involving eroge (i.e., Eroge! Sex & Game Make Sexy Games)
Incest with motion sickness (hahahahahahhahahahha): Imouto Paradise
Favorite plot: Uchi no Otouto Maji de Dekain Dakedo Mi ni Konai? (translated ""My little brother is huge as hell. Wanna come over and see?""
Where I learned that vanilla is too vanilla: Kimi ga Suki
Hentai with my favorite character: Knight of Erin
The one shota you'll ever need to see: OneShota
Ugly bastard (a trope used to empathize with the viewer) hypnotizes his bullies into fornicating with him to spite him: Ijirare: Fukushuu Saimin
Teacher fornicates with his elf students because it is the duty assigned to him: don't remember the name
Unusually decent beach episode: Tsugou no Yoi Sexfriend 4
Apparently Pink Pineapple and Bunnywalker make stellar hentai by animation alone, which is why this hentai is the most liked on the entire site: Overflow Season 1

In conclusion, see how much I've learned? It's truly amazing to see what a UChicago student can do with the right resources. Even in this depraved genre I am aloof, regal, and I ooze with intellectual thirst.
- Thanks to those that support me.
- Sorry if you don't want to see my content.
- To that one guy with the anime argument, intellectuality is meant to be objective and has little correlation with how fun something is to watch.
- See you next time."

We should get lyft rides we can use all week (The University can definitely afford the price of lyft rides, especially because if students die they can't pay the $100,000 of tuition every year so it is an investment).

"CW: Lonliness, Dating

To all the people dismissing the black students' concerns on dating in a predominately non-black environment, here are a few articles that I suggest you read. They range from statistical to personal anecdote and cover stories of black men, women, and LGBT-folk. To my fellow black folk, I hope these serve as proof that you aren't crazy or alone. I love you all.

Statistics:

A recent study about how race and attractiveness affects how likely one is to swipe on Tinder. This study has been replicated multiple times with similar results for black folk.

Another one but for Facebook's dating platform.

Another one but for OkCupid.

Historical articles on race and sexuality:

A list of stereotypes of black people, applicable in this case: Mandingo and Jezebel, and the Mammy.

Qualitative Studies and personal stories:

A study of Asian and Black men in the LGBT space in Seattle. Interesting to take for this article is that while black men were valued for their supposed sexual prowess, they were still less likely to date.

"@ all the posts re: racism and criticism of Chicago violence.

I don’t think it is racist at all to want more ucpd presence or to call out Chicago’s gun violence problem because it IS a problem and everyone deserves to feel safe. What I do think is racist however is that during this discourse SOME (not all but enough for it to be a good 40-50%of y’all) people really do not care about the surrounding communities in that they treat everyone there as if they are all criminals. However the reality is most of those people who have to live in those dangerous areas don’t want to those areas to be dangerous be there anymore than you do. Also the racial profiling that occurs. Like I said it’s not the criticism of violence itself that I find racist but some of y’all real do call people “ghetto” and “thugs” (these are both things I’ve heard) simply for living in Woodlawn past 63rd which is just not okay."

"A Proposal to Do Something More This Time:

What occurred on November 9th is of course unbelievably tragic. To attempt to articulate this sentiment in any other terms below would neither be appropriate nor what those closest would likely want to hear at this moment.

For those experiencing a confluence of fear, sadness, anger, and other unknown emotions: you know it could’ve easily been you. I know it could easily have been me. But more heartbreaking, and worst of all, it was yet another one of us.

It is a tragedy compounded by a context of two others like it already among the university community in a single year, compounded further still by a context of a city in which this problem seems both as old as memory serves and freshly worsening with each passing year – cutting lives short across neighborhood lines and walks of life. We know this is not normal here, and should not be normal anywhere – that to still simply go on without any reflection on what can be done next, would be the greatest travesty of all.

The part I fail to understand? Here, in this small rectangle of land between Hyde Park Blvd and 63rd street, Cottage Grove and Lake Shore Drive, we have some of the most intelligent young minds in the world, some of the most influential connections anywhere, some of the leading experts in every conceivable field, some of the most cutting-edge technology and resources imaginable, a higher concentration of wealth and resources than perhaps anywhere else in the city, and a rich history of those who decided to go against the status quo when it mattered. And yet, we have the audacity here to pass along the bill of trying to reduce violence in Chicago, to others in this city - simply hurling reprimands when it is left unpaid through perceived inaction. Why not us? Why can’t we do this? What ingredients for change-making are we missing that we are waiting for someone else to come in and really make a concerted effort towards fixing things? Why can’t we be the ones to get right what for so long has been a blight on this city, on the people and families that make up its very heart and soul?

I really mean it. Throughout history, university students demanding change around the world have long been responsible for starting tectonic shifts in societies. They’ve protested wars with their lives on the line, been the impetus for the passage or stoppage of landmark laws, stared down fascist dictators with their words, and toppled entire governments. If you believe this to be exaggeration, a quick google search would only prove my underselling the power of students when firmly behind a cause in large numbers. Maybe this is our time to also fight for something bigger than ourselves. Rather than just accept more of the same, or hang on to fear and helplessness, perhaps we are being called upon by the moment to form something that expresses we really mean enough is enough. If making a legitimate attempt to reducing the senseless cycle violence on the streets of this city is going to start anywhere, let’s let it start here: a University full of youthful energy, optimism, and thinking – standing atop an influential and resource-laden platform, and who will absolutely not back down the pressure on power and institutions until real changes in violence all over this city are actually seen.

I don’t make claims to know more than any of you, to feel more deeply than any of you, to empathize more than any of you and in fact, would actively make claims to the opposite. But I do believe that big change is possible in the rare moments when a group of people look at the big problems, and stop viewing them as unsolvable by their own hands – when they set aside the arguments that would bog them down and face a clear goal with determination.

Let’s start a real movement here, one with legs to keep moving, and with arms to push tangible obstacles out of the way. Let’s not get caught in the traps of “continued dialogue” and promises of a “stronger commitment to our communities”. Let's be about loud action this time. Let’s be more than a reaction of sadness the morning after, more than some fear that afternoon, and a passing frustration that night. Maybe we don’t stop demonstrating until we see tangible changes in legislation and the city’s strategy to fight crime. Maybe we refuse attendance at classes/activities for a day or longer in recognition of all that those who have been victims of senseless gun violence in this city will miss, and instead sit in on the University’s offices or even city hall to demand change. Maybe we take a deep and objective look at the data from gun violence in other cities by leveraging the public health, statistics, and public policy experts of this school, and work with our wealth of scholars in all fields to design a comprehensive list of reforms that this city can enact to actually try and make a dent in homicides and crime. Maybe we make such a big stink about violence in this city, one that hasn't been seen at any other University yet, that a whole array of media and politicians (both of which, it should be noted, already hold deep, existing connections to the school) has no choice but to engage seriously with our issues. If not now, then when?

And for once, let’s not lose ourselves in the tangential concerns, in the twists and turns that debates about the means of implementation will perhaps take us. There will be plenty who want nothing more than to see this happen – who will provide as many complicating hypotheticals and factors as there are people to hear them, and will watch eagerly as we implode early and on our own terms because we weren’t unified enough around at least the very fundamental motivations from which we started and the tangible goals and results to which we know we need to arrive. We can’t approach this problem head on, if we’re divided at our very foundations. Maybe we can start from a point of genuine mutual respect for one another in the idea that, at the most basic level, the loss of human life is something we are all inherently against. This is the basis of humanity and to start from a place where you deny even the possibility of this for some of your peers for whatever political position they may hold, is to deny them of this humanity just as they so easily could do to you, all towards no net sum.

To those who ask, why now? Who claim that only when the problem hits close to home, do we feel an obligation to the community. That our inherent privilege as students here should preclude us from speaking out on the topic. To these individuals I question in return, to what end does your cynicism hold? When the ones who have known and suffered longest from this senseless violence have long spoken only to deaf ears, is it not the responsibility of a student body with the wind of influence and power to create change at its back, to step up the most – even if it comes only after the issue lands repeatedly upon its doorstep?

Maybe there will be those who continue to claim this an unsolvable problem - the complete fault of group X and something that group Y’s approach would never allow to happen – and in the process, let apathy replace attempt. Maybe there will be those who continue whining about their own personal inconveniences, sitting back while lambasting the “powers that be” for not making a more concerted effort to do something. Maybe there are some who are content to send out the words “Our city struggles with many of the same issues of violence that afflict all large cities in the U.S.” in the same email announcing the death of yet another student.

But I know that if enough of us truly believe that things don’t have to be this way, big things can happen. Maybe this is a point in time, where we are being called on to affect change in a larger way than we can imagine. Perhaps this is the turning point in the fight to keep our city safer, where one day, communities without their slain children on the streets, can look back and point to the movement students here started - one that took gun violence in the city on its face, refused to simply accept what was already being done, and engaged with it in uniquely objective and results-oriented ways - as being a key reason why.

Even one unnecessary death reflects a failure on all of us. Why should we let this happen in silence? Like it or not, if you are here, you are a part of this city. So let’s make it better. Let’s do something. For real this time.

Signed,
One of You"
"This school just doesnt care about Asians even tho they make up 30% of the school population. All it cares about is political correctness. Two asians killed in a year around campus and the “active” voices have learned to take the whole thing as a norm. No attempt to add ucpd around campus in regions that are predominantly student residences whatsoever. Would the situation be the same if it were two blacks killed? Probably not. But the security measures are still in favor of black criminals over asian victims. Just as the school shut down a Chinese parents safety measures petition by switching the safety seminar time to 2pm (4am in China) with absolute no respect to the dead student’s parents and thousands of other parents in Asia who have not been able to sleep after yesterday, I opened up fb and saw a statue of George Floyd in the top news of New Yorker. America brainwashed by pc is truly at its finest. Its sickening, really."
Now it’s on campus. wtf where is UCPD?
Anyone have an extra diwali ticket i can buy off them? 😩
"Is anyone else just really terrified right now? I know I’m not the only one, but I almost feel like the day after the shooting, nothing felt different. (I’m sure it was, but the fact that my professors said nothing upset me.) It makes me afraid, what if people are jaded now? This is a genuinely horrible event and I feel like the school is underestimating how it affects the students. I don’t like tossing the word traumatized around, but it could wholly be on that level for some students. The shooting occurred where a LOT of off-campus students live. I feel like the administration and faculty is so concerned with placating parents and taking security measures in a timely manner (which they should), that they’re failing to understand the emotional stress students are under and delivering comfort and sensitivity.

I hate how people say “Hyde Park is safe, it’s just like any other big city.” I’m from a big city in the US and I’m not afraid for my life whenever I leave my apartment. People say that you just need to do the “right” things: don’t walk out at night if it’s late, and if you do, don’t go alone. Be aware of your surroundings. This man was walking in the middle of the day and literally one block from campus, which should supposedly be a safe place."
"It's incredibly important for students to realize that UChicago is lying to you. Hyde Park is not safe, full stop. Please travel in groups and take shuttles where possible. Minimize the amount of time you spend walking on a street. Do not listen to anyone who tells you that Hyde Park is safe."
"Notice how the people who are still defending ""abolish UCPD"" are mostly white, privileged, trust fund kids and the people who are worried about crime are Asians who are more likely to be targeted by violent crime? As usual privileged white people are literally causing minorities to die from homicides to push their virtue signaling agenda."
"Don't fear citizens. There will be no need to increase UCPD presence any longer. I will prowl the streets of hyde park to protect its people from the depravities of criminal scum. With only my righteous fury, my fists, and an insatiable hunger for justice I will put an end to all criminal activity in the neighborhood. For I am the night."

"At what point will the university understand that the violence in Hyde Park isn’t supposed to be a part and parcel of going to school here? Platitudes suggesting that the school will work with the city isn’t enough. We’ve all heard this before and it hasn’t worked. The university needs to at least do what’s in its control to make things safer.
1. Increase the frequency of shuttles. Make it an all day round thing, not just the evenings.
2. Increase UCPD patrols in the area. I know police brutality is a problem against POCs but police can be held accountable if they do something wrong. There is no way you can hold gangs accountable for the atrocities they commit. If give every student a UChicago branded mask if you’re worried about wrongful profiling, and train UCPD better to prevent mishaps. Also increase UCPD presence in the area, not just for a few days but for good.
3. Invest in street lighting in places where it tends to get dark due to foliage. In my experience, walking down Blackstone in the night can be pretty scary given that some sections of that street have trees which may block street lights."
"The situation in Hyde Park is not going to change. Everything is politicized. More police ""must"" mean suppressing the community. There was a time some angry dude drived at me yelling. He was about to get out of his car to maybe follow me. I just want to get my degree and get out of this place before I get shot."
Gonna take a break for a bit
"It’s really weird, almost every time I go outside and off campus, there are people - it has always been black people - who make fun of my eyes, call out racial slurs, and sing racist songs at me. I went to Kimbark Beverages and a homeless guy was yelling ch*ng ch*ng and squinting at me. What happened to racial solidarity? Some people at this school probably will tell me that this is my fault, but its just black people being racist to me.

At 2 pm, a Chinese got killed, and the school is doing nothing about it by some gangsters - what do I tell my parents? They are afraid that I am not safe here, and with my experiences, I am not sure that I am, either."
"White liberals don’t understand anything besides their own guilt, and are blind to the fact that Asian people in Hyde park are seriously mistreated by their black “neighbors”. They see all non-whites as a monolithic “PoC”, and ignore any nuance."
"If UChicago actually cared about its students, they'd send everyone home like they did when the pandemic hit. That's the only way to stop this crime surge from affecting students."

"It is, in my opinion, a waste of time of time to sit back and only cry about all the ways the University doesn’t do enough for us - that they can’t completely shape the increasingly harsh reality of what surrounds us to an artificially safe bubble, while we simply sneak in to get our degrees and sneak out after 4 years, leaving this city behind to rot. If three students murdered in one year isn’t enough to convince us, I don’t know what else can be. It’s TIME TO ORGANIZE NOW. We will no longer tolerate an obscene amount of unchecked street violence here, or anywhere else, in this amazing city.. WE are the student body, the ones with the most power. WE (not anybody else) need to GET LOUD, GET CLEAR, and GET SERIOUS. If not now, then when. If not us, then who. WE - not the University’s bulky administration - have the most power to try and fight for real change for families losing children and loved ones to senseless gun violence, families FROM EVERY SINGLE RACE AND BACKGROUND who have for too long suffered the worst kind of pain in Chicago, and want nothing more than to not see similar fates befall others. We need to take it to the mayor, to the DA, and more. We have to say we won’t stop our cries for change until we see the solvency rate for murders and gun violence perpetrators go up, until we see homicides in every neighborhood decrease by double digits, until the state’s attorney, the mayor, the police, and social services all together are held accountable for real results, not just platitudes about what CAN be done if “such and such” approach were used. Let’s think big about what we can fight for and accomplish, and stay unified enough to see it through to the end."

"the fact that it's business as usual after three students have been shot in a year is insane. like the lives of asian international students at this school do not matter.

there is a vocal minority at uchicago, ironically often white, privileged kids, who love to use moral indignation as way to feed their narcissism and ego, at the expense of the realism and nuance that is needed to literally save lives. lambasting the ucpd as racist as though the majority of their ranks are not people of color. arguing that casting blame for violence and murder is racist (as though POC just can't help but murder, right? there's no room for individual agency and accountability if someone isn't white \s) , ignoring the fact that most victims of violence on the south side are POC who desperately deserve peace as well. the person who was shot at on 53rd was a black man advocating against gun violence and running for office. it's a damn crisis.

is your sense of superiority, is winning an argument, so much more important than the lives and safety of your peers and neighbors? you might think your voice is affecting change, but feeling so fucking alone in being afraid and angry drives people to the opposite side of your politics. just give up your pedestal for a second and think, feel, care. please."
"I really appreciate people posting screenshots of the emails they get from the university about the violence in hyde park. I’m a recent grad who still lives in Hyde park and I don’t get any messages like that anymore, so it’s really beneficial to see what’s happening. Whoever is posting it, please keep doing it because you’re helping a lot of alumni!!"

I made the switch this summer after literally being traumatized by the cta from the sheer amount of harassment and assault I'd received that my flight or fight would kick into overdrive everytime i got on the L train combined with the green line shooting, and am never going back. I wish i'd known that it was an option my first year. it's generally much faster too because there are fewer stops"
"How many more HP citizens and students need to die before people stop crying about how more UCPD patrols 2-3 blocks into HP will cause tensions or piss citizens off? Like I can't tell if this is just cap or liberals trying to act woke. The same day a former student was taken from us, there was literally a fatal stabbing a few blocks down, an open firing at 53rd that we all know about, like 4 more shootings (no lives lost fortunately) and dozens of robberies/'minor' crimes. If we go back a few months there have been like 3 more homicides in HP and hundreds of gunfire (including drive-by and flat out gang warfare) in the area. You people really think citizens don't give a fuck or don't want the violence to stop? Like seriously some of you commenting need to think before you fucking post instead of trying to act politically correct. I would be my left arm most of you have never set foot on campus or volunteered in the community during your time here and are just talking out your ass."

"I find it really sad that in light of recent tragedies, instead of using this time and this platform to start thinking about the root causes of violence within Hyde Park, and how we can utilize our position, and privelege as University of Chicago students to work with organizations trying to lessen and mitigate such forms of violence, instead students here have decided to blame the black people that have been in this city before us and will be here after us, calling us gangsters, thugs and otherwise, while advocating for policies that could have drastic effects on the communities outside of uchicago. Obviously, my heart goes out to the victims, their families, and those justifiably unerved by all of this, but this growing trend on secrets to pit the asian struggle against the black struggle is textbook white supremacist tactics. Maybe I should expect less. Maybe I shouldn't spend time scrolling on secrets for my own mental health.

"It’s understandable that students would feel safer with more police presence. It’s also objectively true that police harassment and racial profiling exists within UCPD. The only way to reconcile this should be POLICE TRANSPARENCY and ACCOUNTABILITY.
1) UCPD need to be transparent about the content of “trainings” that officers receive. I suspect that these trainings often reinforce racial profiling tendencies. There are also not enough training on de-escalation, and lots of police lacks professionalism/are overly rude when engaging with community members. This is derived from the log of complaints against UCPD: https://safety-security.uchicago.edu/police/contact_the_ucpd/complaint_process/

2) on the topic of complaints, more community members need to sit on the independent review committee(IRC). Compliant from the community will not be taken seriously if only a few people from the community is included in the review process. If UCPD wants to be better accepted by the community, let community be part of the decision making process."
"why are the dumbasses who are the most social and party the most the ones who wear their masks improperly or straight up don't wear them inside? why can't it be the introverted loner types who do; that'd be so much better, given that they're not the ones I'm concerned about"
"With people dying left and right, my sympathy for not expanding UCPD is running out. Sorry I don’t want to die on campus?!? Didn’t know that this is controversial. UCPD is there to protect college students in this crime-infested city. Of course they’d vet non-college students, and sorry, not my problem. Cannot bring myself to care. Poverty breeds crimes, and I’m not being a collateral damage to this. Thanks"
I will never forget the way the light hit your eyes in that small little room as the sun set on that last day.
Can’t the school with their big endowment and tuition increase do something about this crime surge? Barricade the campus and set up stop points. You can’t come in unless you have a UChi ID or some form of identification. Do it like a gated residence. Campuses should be gated residences.

"all these polls on poll party about proposed security measures are not representative of the general uchicago population. when there is an extreme social cost (being publicly shunned and isolated, having your experiences as a victim ridiculed or devalued) to being upfront about how afraid you are and how supportive you are of increased security, it's irresponsible to use these polls as metrics for student sentiment. These surveys need to protect responder identity to be taken seriously."

"That’s an awful thing to happen, but I don’t get the point of this post? “What happened to racial solidarity” just because there are some idiot racists of a certain race doesn’t mean they represent that whole race, and I wouldn’t expect everyone of one race to be a monolith and all believe in solidarity (though they should). There are racists of every race, which again, is awful, but that doesn’t mean they represent that race so I’m not understanding your point in emphasizing that only black people do this to you here.

(Though I’d also like to point out that the surrounding community is a vast majority black, with most ppl of other races being affiliated in some way with the university (making them more educated in racial matters/less likely to be racist). If you went to college in a suburban white city, I’m sure those saying slurs would be mostly white—not to excuse anyone obviously— but it’s weird to try to cause further divisions by emphasizing the fact that another minority group was racist.)"
It's so funny to see non-Asians railing against UCPD after two possibly race-motivated homicides against Asians. There is so much anti-Asian hate on this campus disguised as anti-racism.

“All these hate crimes.” Just because a crime committed against a particular race doesn’t make it a hate crime fyi. You have to show it was done specifically because of the race. The murder that happened had nothing to do with a hate crime either. Just another violent criminal of the same race that commits most violent crimes. That isn’t racist to say either. Just a fact no matter how you try to minimize it otherwise.

The only saving grace for those of us who aren’t Black, White or Hispanic are the cops, who maybe able to help us folks who are internationals.

"Hi I’m  And  is exactly the shit I’m talking about. Again, advocating for a safer neighborhood in way you think is best isnt racist. But this monolithic view of black people in the surrounding communities certainly is! And so is putting neighbors in quotation marks as if it’s unfathomable for black people to live in Hyde park. (also it’s giving I don’t see black people as actual people) and so is treating everyone in the surrounding communities as criminals even though like I said the vast majority of them don’t want their neighborhood to be unsafe/have dangerous people anymore than we do.

No I’m not defending the people that do commit these hate crimes because they absolutely should be dealt with accordingly. but when you talk like this and say you want an increased police presence while putting a target on people simply because they live in the surrounding neighborhoods and are black what wuite literally are people supposed to think. I’m not saying simply advocating for more ucpd is racist but you gotta understand why people see this and think, “yeah ur fuckin racist” (And again it’s literally 40% of you all that talk like this)"
Can the people who still want to defund UCPD deliver the bad news to families of homicide victims next time?
"These comments calling to ""lock him [the murderer] up"" seriously need to chill out. This kid is younger than all of us and he's going to be sentenced for a long time. It's extremely sad to see a uchic student suffer and it's scary to feel unsafe but these people aren't trying to hurt you, they are neglected through many, MANY different intersections - which UChicago often makes worse through things like the gentrification of hyde park.

Please take your privilege into account when talking and reflecting on this crisis. It's not enough to critique the criminal justice system and the policing of low income communities in your uchic papers. That mentality needs to translate even when you have something to lose. The problem isn't simply that violence has started happening near campus, where ""that stuff shouldn't happen"" bc we go to a rich school. It's happening in part because of us so please at least don't further dehumanize this kid. In fact, he is the same age as all of our first years, who we are so quick to label as young and naive and who are allowed to make mistakes. Try to extend the same empathy to him.

I can't believe we have stooped this low, but this is a real comment someone made. Damn. This is truly what the far left is like these days."

"the best thing the university can do to ethically ""respond"" to recent crime waves is make volunteer hours mandatory for students.

I definitely understand how you feel. Overtime if you stay consistent it'll improve your mental health and you'll appreciate your mirror look more than you used to. Most of the judgement you think is happening is 90% in your head. The people who are actually judgemental aren't worth your time"
at what point are you guys going to realize that we already have a disproportionately large police force and you still don't feel safe? how many times does just adding more cops have to fail before we try literally anything else that might actually change the conditions that produce crime? i know y'all are being emotional and want a security blanket but grow the fuck up
police don't keep you safe. that is not their job.
I don’t understand this? How can you say he “didn’t mean to hurt” anyone? He brought a handgun and shot someone! It is incredibly infantilizing to say that he “didn’t mean it” - he shot a person! Let his actions stand for themselves.
"Defund the UCPD and replace them with what? Community officers? Restorative justice? That might work to improve the overall community environment because most people are reasonable. Respectable citizens can have a conversation to sort conflicts out.

But what if you meet someone who would rob a victim, and then shoot that victim nonetheless? These criminals are in the few. But as we saw, they are there. They are here. You cannot reason with them, and if you run into them, you only have one life. Community officers will hide beneath a car by your side. No other organization except the UCPD can possibly prevent these rare and extreme situations from turning fatal. The UCPD can be restructured, re-trained, etc. so that they better serve this purpose. But until there's a proven alternative for these extreme situations, defund what again?"

"I just want to take this moment to sincerely thank the police officers who are doing their best to get this crisis under control. They are risking their lives each and every day for your safety. So many of you are so ungrateful for the presence that they have on campus. Without them, crime would probably be worse than it currently is and you wouldn’t feel safe to even step outside onto the streets of Hyde Park."
"I'm sorry but if you want to direct your rightful anger and fear at somebody during this chain of tragic murders, you need to direct it at the UChicago administration and particularly the people most responsible for consolidating wealth and institutionalizing suffering for a large majority of the population. They systematically silence the voices of anyone trying to address the underlying causes of this epidemic of violence, and that's because they know that their wealth and prestige literally relies on the exploitation of the poor and despairing in this country and around the world. Any attempt to address the factors underlying these tragic murders means challenging a regime of capital accumulation. It would mean a serious conversation about the existence of a project like UChicago as an elite institution and agent of mass gentrification in the Southside period.

The backlash against the abolish UCPD and defund UCPD movements is understandable, especially when those movements seem privileged and largely white (although tbh that's not really true that abolition is just a bunch of white ppl... ). Most of that discourse misses the point of prison/police/PIC abolition. Not a single abolitionist worth their salt wants to just abolish the police tomorrow. It's a vision, horizon, and practice. The point is, a surveillance state police force cannot, clearly did not, and never will stop tragic murders such as these. That can only happen by building a world where murder is unthinkable, which happens through strong communities and transformative/restorative community accountability practices in the face of harm. Presence not absence.

Which, again, direct your anger at admin because they're the ones who categorically refuse to seriously engage the teachings and practices of PIC abolition as anything but an impossible joke. In declaring their intent to partner with Mayor Lightfoot and increase CPD's presence, they've made it very clear that they plan to repeat the same mistakes. There's no possible chance they could take a look in the mirror and even so much as consider how their arrogance and elitism has left large portions of the population suffering and depraved of the basic resources needed to thrive."
"Jesus I think I just lost brain cells reading this. The problem most definitely isn’t that students “don’t feel safe” enough. Three dead students who were simply going about their business in the city and didn’t expect to get sh*t are a testament to that.

Community activism is great and hearing from local leaders is great, but something tells me the guys responsible for these deaths aren’t exactly pillars of Hyde Park or the South Side in general. So it’s not like the exposure there would lead to some sort of weird friendship between UChicago students and potential shooters. Besides, when students are actively targeted (typically for robbery) it’s because they 1) almost certainly have valuables (electronics) and 2) are easy targets (unarmed or can’t fight). Not because Hyde Park residents don’t like UChicago, regardless of if that’s true.

As for reform? Yeah reform is a good thing and probably will help long term, but generally takes a while. Unless you are okay with several students getting k*lled per year in the short term, then bumping UCPD presence and additional free Lyft’s, etc. is a pretty good solution. Forcing students to spend more time on the streets where they are clearly at risk is not."
"I’m going to be honest - the more ridiculously ripped the person you see at the gym, the more likely they are to be judgement-free and totally down to even help you in whatever. In fact, they’ll probably even bully anyone who judges you, absolutely for free. It’s against the bro code to judge anyone at the gym."
"If anyone can propose this idea to student government, it would be much appreciated. Instead of making everyone pay for a UPass that a lot of people are not using right now, would it be possible to get like $100 towards Lyft that we can use? Or is it possible to extend the Lyft hours to earlier in the day because it is dark by like 5 pm. I don't really feel safe taking the CTA, and ubers/lyfts are really expensive."

"I’m back at uChicago after taking some time off because of the pandemic, the atmosphere of the school has at the moment upsets me. Before the pandemic, I feel like campus had a different vibe. It was more welcoming, brimming with life, and it felt like a community. I started to feel connected to the people here and I felt like it was my home. But now, it feels alienated and disconnected. People are more asocial, people stick to their own pods (they’ve gotten used to this because of quarantine pods), people are less social in classrooms and rsos. People socially withdraw more because maybe everyone’s just more depressed. It just doesn’t feel the same, and I feel upset. Also, many of my friends were upperclassmen, and the fact that they’re not here anymore and there are less familiar faces makes me sad. Makes me feel like people just come and go and that’s it."

"I can’t begin to fathom how some of the brightest minds in the world can approach students getting gunned down in broad daylight, essentially on campus, as an ivory tower intellectual exercise and an opportunity to virtue signal. There are obviously innumerable social problems to solve in Hyde Park and beyond, but how can we solve anything if we’re getting shot on our campus? Three students dead in less than a year is absolutely unacceptable and hiding behind woke talking points isn’t saving any lives. No one’s hard life gives them license to murder someone, and newsflash: people still commit murder even when they are financially stable. So instead of making abstract claims about implementing political theory, let’s focus on keeping our community members from getting killed. This is not the average neighborhood. It’s adjacent to some of the most dangerous areas in the nation. Above average danger calls for an above average solution, which obviously includes police. It’s so simple and straightforward. I’m dumbfounded as to how some of you can’t understand that. How many people have to die before academia deems their lives worth protecting? I don’t want to die on my own campus because my classmates have a fetish for racializing everything. It’s clearly not what this is about, and pitting everyone against each other to validate your political philosophies is abhorrent. After this week, I’m so frustrated, disheartened, and frankly, terrified."
"Disagree. 24 hour study areas only promote burnout for already burnt out college students.

POC and intl students at this school are much more likely to be in favor of defunding the cops than most white people I know here.

- increase in policing decreases crime (papers that demonstrate this typically demonstrate causality, instead of the large number of association studies which fail to separate reverse causality, e.g.: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418829500096221, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951346 (somewhat of a meme, but the results still hold after the correction), https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00240.x, https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/426877)
- the deterrence effect is real (https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670398)
- incarceration reduces reoffending rates (https://yotamshemtov.github.io/files/Rose_Shemtov_2021_Manuscript.pdf)
- lax gun laws increase homicide rates (https://secureservercdn.net/45.40.146.38/3c2.7cc.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Colmer_Doleac_Apr2021.pdf)
- poverty is associated with crime (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176507000201?casa_token=NCuuEA9XoXMAAAAA:X5QVSdEDD-z9Vz_GQmOqzVbk5Ecxi7m9N0r47_GmxMUrn2ItrbMPpWg_SIl-u0PVOYGraQ)

Unfortunately, the solution to crime requires policies that neither the left nor the right fully embrace. But if people keep fighting back and forth on Tucker Carlson or defunding the police or whatever, this shit is never going to get solved. What's worse is that the people who are most passionate about this debate on crime aren't Asian or blacks. It's white ultraliberals and white ultraconservatives arguing back and forth while Asians and blacks are dying from dysfunctional policing and dysfunctional levels of crime.

We need to:

1. increase policing
2. increase deterrence
3. ban guns
4. fix poverty"
bro we get it you’ve read Marx now please shut the fuck up
"Any recent graduates reading this, what are you doing now and in what way (if at all) did UChicago contribute to you getting to where you are now? So like, for example, was it just a checkbox that shows you have a degree? Or did you get a job through connections or some kind of activity you started on campus? Or did some recruiter assume you were smart because you went to UChicago? Did it not help in any way at all? Etc. I'm in that stage where I'm trying to decide what I want to do with my life, and I also feel like I haven't taken advantage of many opportunities during my time here so far."
"Only at UChicago can you hear such brain-dead arguments about how “the people committing murder are the REAL victims”. You’re not revolting against “the man” by killing a 24yo university graduate, you’re just a murdering asshole.

My heart goes out to everyone else who’s ever been robbed/shot/assaulted by one of the “poor, disenfranchised souls” living around Hyde Park, not only for the horror of your experience, but for the utter lack of sympathy and solidarity from your classmates, who would happily see student deaths happen weekly and do nothing about it but remind us that “the real evil is some rich white guy, and they’re victims too”.

It is okay to be furious at the unjustifiable murder/assault of your fellow students, it is okay to want an increased police presence if it makes you feel safer walking to fucking class, which you should NEVER feel afraid for your life doing, and it is okay to tell these “do nothing but blather on about dismantling the system” people that they’re full of shit."
Does anyone else here keep reading the most recent Thinker articles and walk away feeling like throwing up? I understand having a dialogue about police and safety in Hyde Park but wtf are they doing invoking the death of a student and attaching it to some anti-“leftist” propaganda and calling for the national guard of all things?
The fact that there are a number of students that refuse to listen to the video tells you about the intolerance of some of the student body. It’s always good to hear and know what other people are listening to

"Is it just me or I’m not the only one feeling the new dining commons food provider is much much much worse than our previous one, Bon Appetit?"
So the University has apparently just subverted the moderation at the UChicago sub-reddit and purged all crime comments and threads and permanently banned students en masse. Rationalization this with a series of new policies which read like they were crafted by a team of lawyers. W-t-f.

"The goal of expanded police presence is deterrence. If having more frequent patrols in the surrounding area around campus makes someone think twice about committing a violent crime, then mission accomplished."
"Increasing community engagement, economic opportunities, and providing better education & resources for South Side residents are long-term solutions in addressing violent crime in the South Side. These proposals are absolutely necessary, but they will take years to implement. In order to prevent more violent crimes during this ongoing national crime wave, the only feasible short-term solution is to increase police presence & patrolling. It's unfortunate, but it's one of the only realistically feasible solutions available to University admin in preventing another student shooting while the crime wave tides over."

"As an Asian person, the defund UCPD protests outside of Provost Lee's house were high-key racist. Y'all really didn't need to graffiti Chinese/Cantonese insults outside of her house.

"Genuinely never been more disgusted with the student body than when I read this. “Someone whose life MEANT SOMETHING ended by someone who NEVER HAD A FUTURE”?????? Oh my god just say the n word and be done with it! The barbaric and essentialist views you have of black people who have been suffering for years at the hands of this university, city, and country are actually disgusting. I’m not at all excusing his actions, he’s a grown ass man with agency who killed another human being. But Jesus, if you think he “never even had a future”, key word being “NEVER HAD” - as in, implying even prior to him becoming a killer - you’ve got internalized bullshit to work through. It’s just so disheartening to hear all the quiet parts out loud."
How did his passing turn into a call to racially profile black people? Now I have two reason to be scared to be in this campus.
Should they have to? No. Is it a necessity in any big city in the US? Absolutely. 
"I'm not one to use current events to make larger comments about people and their views, but I'll make an exception here. It's very disappointing to see students use lofty ideas from sociology texts and political activism to reinterpret what safety means. To any normal person, if there's a significant risk that someone will approach you with the intention of causing you harm or taking something away from you, you're unsafe. Looking at the statistics, it is abundantly clear that this risk is higher in Hyde Park than in the vicinities of most other universities in the country, and that the risk in Hyde Park has increased to a concerning level in the past year or two. Regardless of who approaches me or what circumstances led them to approach me - if someone is approaching me with the intention of causing me harm, I am unsafe. And if they're an adult human being, they're responsible for their actions. Period."
Did some crisis management firm just seize control of the subreddit on behalf of the College and make it a safe space for pro-U. of C. and pro-Hyde Park propaganda? Way to turn a local crime wave into the dissolution of the College's entire brand and niche.
I love how people don’t realize that the suburbs are getting hit by crime too. Kim Fox let rapists and murderers go back to their communities and train the next generation. The carceral system works and no professor at this school has convinced me that letting these scumbags out on the street is a good thing.

If that idea, the idea of more funding to police, makes you uncomfortable and want to silence those opinions, then how do you deal with other issues in a democratic society? You are just children, emotional, petulant children, who demand the world remain comfortable to you and just can't deal with the consequences of pluralism."

you all have found a way to make the question of safety and the subject of a student’s passing into antiblackness. Discuss police all you want bur for the love of god we’re getting opinions such as “racial profiling makes sense because students are the priority” as if black students don’t go here. PLEASE STOP thats TERRIFYING.
Yo wtf is the neural networks midterm this shit is insane
if y’all really cared for “student safety” you would not so readily advocate for more ucpd. ucpd has a history of shooting students too ya know.
"If you are against increased police presence near and on campus, I encourage you to skim the UCPD daily incident reports (https://incidentreports.uchicago.edu/) from the past few months, which include so much more information than the security alerts. You will see that people in our community, BOTH AFFILIATED AND UNAFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY, are dealing with life-threatening situations on a daily basis. It is absolutely disrespectful to all the victims to not acknowledge the systemic nature of this issue. Also keep in mind that the log is still only limited to the information the UCPD has, which means that the situation is yet even worse than the log can portray. Many people, again both affiliated and unaffiliated with the university, are being hurt by the lack of security on and near campus RIGHT NOW, and while systemic change is needed, short term solutions will save lives. Again, if you read the daily logs, you will find that the UCPD and CPD are both capable of intervening in most situations, benefitting everyone who lives in Hyde Park. Increasing police presence means more of that, and does not preclude efforts to keep police accountable."

"From what sources did you claim that international students or POC don’t want to expand UCPD?? Also international students and POC are not necessarily the same group. There’s also a huge difference in attitude from POC international students who are not American and are thus not used to the violence in America, since their countries don’t have gun violence like this. Way to go to lump groups of people together"
"“UCPD didn’t get defunded and the tragedy still happened” Bru this is survivorship bias. You look at 3 deaths and think UCPD doesn’t work. Without UCPD, there would be way more than 3 deaths (which is already too much), cause what the hell is deterring criminals from robbing and killing??"
"It's you and me, rat"
Lol why are you so offended by the fact that the one poster said the 24 year old’s life was worth something. They never said he was worth something because he had an education. Maybe a person’s worth is driven by their choices. You all sound like people with extreme savior complexes. Go outside. Touch some grass.
"Never been more disgusted with those of you who sympathize with the criminal and not with our fellow students who were killed in these gun violence this year. Yes we have read Marx and know that those criminals were disenfranchised and oppressed systematically due to their socioeconomic status and upbringing. But nothing like this could justify murder of innocent students. This was not the only option. And while we all know that the fundamental solution would require a society that is more just and equal, that is going to take very long and we cannot allow any tragedy like this to happen again. Police with weapons can serve as deterrence to potential criminals who will think twice before trying armed robbery here again. This shitshow must stop."
"Only in America would you have people seriously calling for the abolition of the police, apparently because the police as an institution is racist and doesn't keep anybody safe. Name one country in the world that doesn't have a police force. Even fucking Lichtenstein has one. Now we're supposed to think that hiring more social workers and mental health professionals will somehow magically solve all the crime we have, and everybody will sing kumbaya. What next, calling for the abolition of prison? *Checks notes* Oh no..."

Someone who knew exactly what they were going to get from this armed robbery: $200. Yet fucking shot and killed someone for it anyway. This person was not forced into murder by gentrification. This person was committing crimes long before 100% of you fuckers defending him were even at this school. This person was just evil. Fuck each and every one of you defending him."

"Advice from a fourth year pre-med on how to tell others you're a pre-med without telling them you're a pre-med:
1. tell everyone you're a pre-med
2. make small talk by talking about your GPA and how stressed you are for the MCAT
3. dominate office hours by asking multiple questions to prevent other people from getting a chance (GPA is all or nothing)
4. only make friends in the class to check answers with
5. check answers with the TA and instructor in office hours by masking your true desire with confusion/uncertainty (works everytime)
6. bathe in the contempt others have for pre-meds

Being scared for your safety in the face of evidence that you are not safe is a normal fucking response you out of touch ghouls. How dare you say that anyone is wrong for being scared after what we've gone through in the last year. Re-evaluate yourself because any attempt to excuse or downplay what these murderers have done is morally reprehensible shit, regardless of whatever sociology theory bullshit you might try to justify it with."
"Dear CareNotCops: There are around 100 UCPD cops and each costs $100K to $150K per year all-in. That's $10 to 15 million dollars annually. It's laughably juvenile to think $10 to 15 million additional dollars into Southside wrap-around resources or hugs or whatever is a silver bullet for the over 60 sq. mi. and 750,000 residents of the Southside. It wouldn't even register in an area which already receives and deploys billions a year trying to elevate residents. You are attention-craving nihilists and clearly lack real world experience.

"Stop blaming other students for a much larger problem. If you haven’t noticed, UCPD has not been defunded even slightly. I disagree with Care Not Cops, but nothing they did led to this tragedy."
Are there any girls in the defund and abolish police groups or are they are all hideous? Because me and my girlfriends are constantly harassed and sometimes followed whenever we leave the UCPD patrol zone. None of this shows up on crime reports but it's still terrifying and traumatizing.

And this dual policing talking point makes no sense - the only time I see CPD is in the Dunkin (mask-less ofc) grabbing a donut and then pissing off.
Also the current system of having safety persons freezing their asses off on every corner of the campus makes no sense. I appreciate them being there
- but what are they going to do to prevent shootings?

I hate the police - but what does CNC propose as a genuine solution to stem these events? We've had 16 shootings in HP this year so far. Yes that's less than other Chicago neighborhoods - but the standard should be 0.
It was all very well when we were talking about how to appropriately respond to mental health episodes, etc. But we're talking about gunmen.
We can have conversations about better policing - in tandem with one about making the community safer.

Otherwise we just end up with a less safe neighborhood and empower bad faith actors like Tucker Carlson who dgaf about HP and other southside residents."
"An armed robbery literally happened right next to south on Friday. It was across the street from a blue emergency light, in front of an apartment building full of students. And there's supposed to be a UChicago security guard right there on the corner watching for these kinds of incidents.

"As an international student studying social sciences here, I can definitely understand why some of you don't want the police. However, I think it's lunatic to think that by getting rid of the police, America would be a better place. The racial and socioeconomic inequality in the United States is incredibly bad compared to most functioning states in the world, primarily due to capitalism and neoliberalism, and this is why the crime rate is so f***king high. If you think that taking out police while maintaining capitalism can magically eliminate violence and crimes, you are living in your fantasy.

Police is an oppressive institute by nature, just as state and capitalism. However, in many countries of the world, the police are much less oppressive than here and actually maintain decent social orders. Instead of ranting about defunding the police, perhaps look at other countries and think about how you can make police here less racist and oppressive. I do hope we can see a world where individuals live freely without forms of power suppressing them politically and economically, but unfortunately, this vision is far away. If such progress ever happen, it's not in the US. So please be realistic and be respectful to people who don't feel safe. Advocate for reform within the policing system instead of defunding it. Advocate for the abolishment of capitalism instead of just abolishing the police."
"It’s absolutely valid to criticize some of the impacts UChicago has had on the surrounding community, but to act like the university has done nothing to improve the south side through community work ignores so much of what the school offers. There’re tons of programs to improve K-12 education on the south side, bring new jobs, and improve infrastructure. Not to mention that the university has classes every quarter that allow students to directly work with community leaders to help fix neighborhood issues and improve business districts around the south side. Im not trying to justify gentrification, just pointing out that the university isn’t ignoring the south side community in the way some of the secrets posts claim"

"Is it just me, or is anyone else really hoping that Rittenhouse gets let off? As more and more evidence accumulates in the case, it is clear that Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense. By the prosecutor’s witness’s own admission, Rittenhouse only fired upon the individual when they pointed their gun at him. With regards to the people who were killed, they violently attacked Rittenhouse and ran at him, leaving Rittenhouse no choice but to act in self-defence. Rittenhouse was carrying his firearm legally, and only fired when put in a position of self-defence. He did not actively go out of his way to murder people, which is why the only ones who were killed were those who attacked him. Why is it necessarily a right-wing stance to hold this view?"

"I'm uncomfortable with some of the systematic, structural, and institutional biases present in this student body. Some students are calling for increased police presence without consideration of the destabilizing consequences of such a move. Cops are systematically, structurally, and institutionally oppressive other organizations that impede any development in the community. We have to not just be aware of our privileges, but act on them to make the community a better place at the expense of our own safety, and now that I have all the leftists' attention and am starting to run out of leftist keywords, this is how you sound.

This empty talking is not silly. It is some utopia fever dream. We need cops not because most people in Hyde Park are good, but because a few are criminals. We shouldn't defund the UCPD because this move, in your lingo, will have far-reaching consequences not just for you, but for the community as a whole - and that includes a large body of students who disagree with you."
"I might be a selfish Asian, but after the pandemic began I do feel much safer when I see a cop / security guard on the street. yes, I feel I'm less likely to become a hate crime victim when cops are around. I understand some people are not that comfortable with police around but there are also people like me who really appreciate the presence of UCPD and try to live/walk within high UCPD presence areas. Can we just try to make UCPD more efficient, transparent and accountable instead of trying to defund or abolish them? I know UCPD isn't perfect but I honestly can't imagine how Hyde Park would be without them..."
lmfao not the Poll Party pussies unable to handle the idea that there are others at this school with opinions different from theirs 😂 Bruh listen up.

To the secrets addressing “pretty women” being harassed, yes I was harassed BY A UCPD OFFICER my first year while volunteering (yes, I do know the difference between UCPD and the contract workers on the corners)

Also, uchicago students believe that increased security officers (WHO ARE OUR AGE - have you even talked to them?) is the solution, when often they’re just figure heads that make you “feel” safe and don’t actually deter violence. In the event of violence why do you feel that you r life is worth more than theirs? They didn’t “sign up” to die either."
"My American friends are so dismissive when I talk about how I’m nervous going out of campus after dark. Like, sorry that shootings weren’t normal in my life? It’s not enough to say every major city HAS crime — obvsly I know — but that shouldn’t be part and parcel of my college experience."
"No matter what what systemic issues you faced, there is no justifying taking a human life. Nobody gets to take a human life and get away with it.

The woke ass fuckers in the UChicago community: Please fucking grow out of your research papers and live the world the way it actually is. For a community which can possibly boast some of the brightest minds the known university, you guys surely have your heads up your collective asses just for social cred."

"Just walk in pairs, they say. On Thursday around midnight a pair of students was robbed by 3 gun-toting local youth adjacent South. Any more sage advice, you Ivory Tower dipshits?"
"Genuinely curious, where did the “UCPD is the second largest private militia in the world, second only to the Vatican Swiss guard” come from? I’ve heard several different versions of UCPD being the largest police force in (insert region here). Can this be fact checked?"
"People are gonna say you're racist but it's just statistics and you should keep yourself safe - no one blames women when they avoid strange men walking near them at night, it's the same thing here."
"Oh, shut the FUCK up. UCPD has shot a single student in the past 6+ years, in the SHOULDER, after trying to talk him down for TWO FUCKING MINUTES because said student RUSHED THE OFFICER WITH A METAL PIPE that he was using to bash windows/cars. The fucking cam footage is somewhere on youtube. God. Just because someone was having a mental health episode doesn't mean a police officer, who, by the way? STILL A FUCKING HUMAN BEING, deserves to get fucking smashed with a metal bat."
"Honestly it is genuinely funny what a bunch of pussies students are here
Yea, you live in a major city at a university that agglomerates wealth bordered by populations that it stole from then left in the dust, then act like a bunch of literal whiny babies when you realize that you aren’t at summer camp and bad shit sometimes happens

Just shut the fuck up please god, people who actually live here have been fighting to stop this violence for years and thinking you and your private army is the solution is so insanely stupid"
I was adhd spaced out when all this debate started and now I feel left out
"Re: 

From what sources are you claiming the inverse? You were, after all, the person claiming that only rich white kids were in favor of abolishing UCPD, thereby lumping everyone else (international and American POC) on the opposition."
"The only difference between y’all and a desperate armed robber is y’all were born lucky and got to live in a mansion and go to prep school. An armed robber had to grow up in a ruthless jungle.

"silly LIBERAL, chicago already HAS tons of gun control, so more gun control won't solve the violence problem. anyway, we need sixty kajillion more police officers"
40% of cops
"Defund the police is a movement that started off saying that police (at least in the US) have become this entity that is supposed to solve everything from violent crime to mental health crises to drug abuse, and we need to reallocate funds away from the police to other organizations better equipped to deal with non-crime related issues, as well as those trying to solve the root causes of crime like poverty etc.

I don't believe anyone can genuinely argue that there is a better alternative to the police in dealing with violent crime.

That being said, a student was literally shot to death right next to campus in the middle of the day. It wasn't an accident, nor a case of mistaken identity, nor an altercation, nor any other reason you can think of. This is by definition the most violent crime we could possibly witness right here on campus.

I think the initial ideas around defund the police were quite sound, but you cannot simply use a catchphrase as your end goal. What is ucpd's role? I think they have almost exclusively focused on crime, which should be the main focus of a police force.

We can argue about how many officers there should be, how often they should patrol, etc. But at the end of the day, if we defund ucpd, those who are able to afford better safety will chose such options (taking ubers everywhere, living in a gated complex, possibly hiring private bodyguards or whatnot). That is what happens in any society when safety and security is no longer a public good. Only those who can afford to be safe will be safe."
"I'm genuinely curious how did Obama live in Hyde Park as a senator. Did it use to be safer? He frequented a number of restaurants on 53rd / in the area, so it's not like he was always sheltered at home/work."
"democrats and republicans say they're different, but really they're quite similar. when republicans are in power, they govern as if their agenda is what's best for the country, even if the majority thinks it isn't. when democrats are in power, they ALSO govern as if the republican agenda is what's best for the country."
It makes me so proud to see people being real about safety on campus on this page. Turns out the stupid sociology majors who’ll deny reality are just a vocal minority
"@ reply girl no, you weren’t blacklisted for talking about rape culture, you were blacklisted for offering to flash the people manning the door so that you could get in 🤡 you’re the first to call people out when they make you uncomfortable but the last to admit how uncomfortable YOU make others."
low-key it's really funny that that reply guy went from saying whiteboard girl gets the wall in the revolution to sounding exactly like the thinker bc he loves cops
F**k*r KKKarlson
"Very content that the recent tragic developments have given CNC some major ass whooping. The ideology behind the entire organization is essentially founded upon discrimination directed towards the entire security industry, which safeguards the most valuable aspect of human life: life.
Very much like how not every single Chad is an alpha male, not all police officers is a Derek Chauvin. That guy is a colossal dick, but how can you say the same for the selfless, dutiful officers stationed at every block of campus next to the blue pillars? We all love to complain about the stiflingly cold Chicago weather…that these officers have to endure on a nightly basis in exchange for our safety, so is it that difficult to NOT antagonize the very force of people standing between you and a bullet to your heart? I’m sorry, but it seems like the greatest enemy of CNC aren’t the “racists” or “rascals of the right” but the very REALITY of our community illuminated by the skyrocketing crime rates.

If we seriously get rid of the entire UCPD, Istg I’ll pack up my sht and catch the first Uber to Northwestern, where I can avoid the real-life version of the Purge that will blow up in Hyde Park."
"I do not think the issue of safety would in any way be solved during our stay here. Those things I imagine are much more intricate than having law enforcers present whatever their number and have to do more with the environment and how it affects its people. If you grew up believing this a way to go through life, you'll find a way to exercise your beliefs at the expense of others. I do think that the right move is to put more resources into the betterment of the community, but it'd be dumb to believe that doing so wouldn't at least take like another generation for it to have its hoped effects."
": To add to this, even if the defund the police movement was reasonable (which it isn't), to add UCPD to it makes no sense. UCPD hardly ever uses force and does not use a dime of the public's money."
Maybe what they don’t think I understand is something I already do
"Dennis Shaoxiong Zheng was raised in a single family and came from Leshan, Sichuan Province which has $6000 annual GDP per capita as of 2019(less than 1/10 of Chicago) and less than 1/4 of this back in the early 2000s. He was not from a privileged background. Maybe try to sympathize with him and his family, or is that too difficult because he is international/Asian/Chinese? So that this won’t fulfill your self righteousness in advocating for your preferred type of minority?"
For the people that say “if you don’t like it here then transfer”: DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?? This is the same logic as “if you don’t like the US then move elsewhere.” WOW. So you think people are not allowed to criticize a place while living there? WOW. Insert *when ur so far left you end up on the right*
"Ayo what the fuck? All the first years have been going at it in Woodlawn and now there’s a chlamydia outbreak… smh my head 😮‍💨😮‍💨

Not even 🧢"
“If you feel unsafe just TRANSFER” is the weird progressive version of “if you don’t like America JUST LEAVE”. boundlessly expanding the ucpd might not be the solution but so many defund and CNC posts here just mock genuine concerns people have about not getting shot
"Genuinely asking as a stem major not previously exposed to all the lines of arguments against reinforcing UCPD's presence on campus. I'm sincerely looking for an opportunity to get educated and don't mean it in a passive-aggressive way:
1. What is the harm that UCPD does, beyond racial profiling? Why is UCPD *not* a better alternative than CPD? Or is it just an extra burden for black people in addition to CPD? If we disband UCPD, would people rather prefer direct policing by CPD, without UCPD serving as the buffer zone?
2. Doesn't UChicago Hyde Park offer better employment opportunities to black residents than the rest of South Side does?"
"The university’s stealing form Hyde Park??? Lol please take a look around you. Hyde Park is a comparatively better and safer neighborhood than any other south neighborhoods in Chicago. The majority of the stores in Hyde Park are black-owned businesses, whose main customers are the students. Not to mention the K-12 programs etc the the university offers. Please tell me how the university steals and leaves Hyde Park in the dust again."

"So now y’all are saying that people who walk around in Canada goose and airpods should have known better?? So now we’re doing victim blaming and saying what you wear dictates what you deserve? Also, as a friendly reminder, the recent student whose life was stolen from him and MANY others who were robbed are NOT walking around in expensive clothes. Many are actually on fin aid and literally just walk around with their phone and backpack like every one else. Please check your delusion."
golly what a hot take. Must’ve really hurt your head with this copy paste.
It was reported the killer sold the belongings he stole for less than 100$ so stfu.

Where can I get a rapid COVID test done near/on campus?
"To those who want to defund the police: even if UCPD vanishes now, the university and the community won’t grow closer (just by undoing the police). Admit that south side is loaded with entrenched social problems. Admit that if I grow up in a gang I won’t learn to be kind with the armless but rich students simply because they denounce police. They do my convenience. I gunned down them more. Admit that the toxic relationship in this area won’t degenerate right after UCPD leaves. Admit that the VICIOUS CYCLE of south side violence has already been underway for long. You are in it. What we can do is either a revolution or a stronger division i.e. more police. Alas."

I mean, just recently I saw someone write a 1.5 paged, double-spaced essay length response to someone who told them to stop coming to class because their wet cough was distracting. In reality, all they needed to say was ""I can't because the professor doesn't record the lectures nor do they provide a Zoom link for me to join in virtually"". Not all responses need to be formatted as academic essays and kudos for reply guy for being able to say that publicly."
"In response to that post about being scared of black men walking on the street...a frat was literally banned from throwing for a year due to a mass drugging and a sexual assault case. And yet the student body still turns out in droves fri/sat nights to frat events. Are you scared every time a white man with greasy hair and a Patagonia t-shirt chats you up at a party? Nah bc every other race can commit crimes with impunity. The second a black person does something tho, suddenly they stand for their entire race."
"Why does the emergency fund not accept the most straightforward emergencies?

"Here's what UChicago should do for the safety of their students - just give everyone a firearm and lessons in how to use it. Then, when they get robbed/mugged, the people who think that people who commit violent crimes are just ""lost souls"" or whatever can let themselves get shot and those of us with brains can actually fight back."
"This might be a dumb question, but where are people getting the idea that hyde park/washington park/kenwood residents don’t like UCPD from? My whole family and most of my family friends are from hyde park and the surrounding south side neighborhoods. All of them have said they really like the corner security guards and have never expressed any concerns with expanding UCPD patrols. If you go to the neighborhood boards and facebook pages you’ll hear similar sentiments. There’s obviously a huge push from POC and black communities in chicago for accountability and redistribution of funding in CPD, but I honestly just haven’t seen anything but support for UCPD’s security patrols (which is what people are pushing to expand)."
Saw too many posts quarreling over increasing or abolishing UCPD/CPD but why don’t we discuss gun control at this moment?
"Been waiting all week for my professors to acknowledge the recent violence, and not one of them has said a word so far. Not expecting a full discussion, just some recognition that it happened and it’s terrible and might be affecting students. It’s very weird to feel sad and scared about a murder that everyone on campus knows about, and then I go to class and it’s just business as usual. Obviously some professors are talking about it among themselves, but others not saying anything seems to me like they’re pretending it never happened."
"I mean I agree completely, but is it not easier to work on having better situational awareness than it is to solve the entirety of Chicago’s violent crime problem?

Criminals are the problem… but that doesn’t mean I’m not going to question the judgment of a student who decides to walk due south wearing wireless noise canceling headphones and a canada goose jacket."
can you get Metcalf funding for the summer after 4th year?
"just so y'all know, not all black people fear the police, but a lot of us don't express it publicly to avoid being ostricized by the community. i personally wouldn't mind increased policing/security/surveillance around campus if it means i can walk around hyde park without worrying about getting mugged/shot or dying an early death."
"Shame on everyone calling for UCPD expansion, but also shame on Care Not Cops for not doing shit to change these disgusting campus narratives. Why are they retreating precisely in the moment they could be doing the most?"
"Nah nah nah I know y'all didn't go to a pro-police protest with a ""no justice, no peace"" sign"
this school and it’s student body are so violently and blatantly anti-black I’m genuinely disgusted.
"If you can’t talk about student safety without using racist and classist dogwhistles then perhaps student safety isn’t your real concern.

Safety should always be the top priority, but some of you need to wake up and realize you live in a large city. Some of you think this university or a private police force can fix poverty and need a serious reality check. This issue is larger than you and if you feel unsafe, leave."

"I hope everyone whose been hurt by violent crimes either directly or indirectly heals. Either way, I don’t believe students directing anger at each other will not help it will only hurt the lot of you more.

Wow what a fascinating graph
"According to the Chicago Tribune’s reporting on the bond hearing, murder suspect Alton Spann resided on the 6500 block of S Maryland avenue. That’s five blocks away from campus. What a phenomenal neighbor we have!

Besides supporting more police presence, Hyde Park natives interviewed by the Chicago Thinker also mentioned how nearby elements of violence drive to Hyde Park and commit violent crimes.

We need deterrence and we need arrests. If any suspicious vehicle enters Hyde Park, it needs to be chased down and inspected."
"I find it really annoying how stupid some ppl are at this school. 1) Cops are useful, if they didnt exist there would be way more murders by now, so dont act like cops do nothing. 2.) ucpd has not been defunded, in fact they increased the force and funding past year or so. so pls stfu thinker abt carenotcops, theyre a useless org no one listens to, esp the adminstration (thank god). 3.) stop screaming at admin like theyre doing nothing, they do far more than yall idiots know abt. Esp listening to your ideas on how to improve safety i thank god yall dont determine our safety policies."

Bro I don’t get this shit when ppl say “lol UChicago people are so sheltered they don’t think the green line is safe”

I have literally had some creepy dude touch me or shout racially and sexually charged stuff at me 90% of the times I have ever walked onto public transit that wasn’t the 171 or 172. I don’t feel safe on public transit not because I’m some sheltered suburban racist, but because experience has taught me that I. AM. NOT. SAFE. THERE.

I am regularly cat called and followed by men in cars and on foot, when I’m on campus and off!? Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do??? So many people’s suggestions smell like victim blaming couched in sosc-class leftist dialogue. Like bro…some dude started touching me on the red line when I was wearing baggy sweatpants and a hoodie, but somehow it’s not his fault for doing that, because of the socioeconomic circumstances surrounding his life - that’s laughable. People have agency, and sometimes “even” poor people use that agency to hurt others."
"TW: Ass*ult

I am an Asian-American student who was physically assaulted because of my race this year at the red line. I was waiting at the platform when a man called me ch*nk, ripped my mask off, and lunged at me attempting to push me off the platform as the train to Howard arrived. Had I been a couple steps closer to the edge of the platform or had a bystander (a Black local, mind you) not stepped in, the remnants of my corpse would have likely laid on the tracks of Garfield for all to see.

I'm sure all of you are aware of this (and especially my fellow POC, asian or not), but feeling like you're being discriminated against because of your race is painful and that pain is real. For months after that incident I felt like I couldn't breathe on the platform or on the red line, regardless of where on the line I was. I still can't wear my hair the same way I wore it that day, and I can't wear the same clothes I wore that day. The truth of the matter is that here, Asians are perceived to be weak, helpless, and defenseless, and even if something were to happen to us, we'd keep our head down and say nothing. Maybe that's why we've seen so many Asian students harassed, assaulted, and killed recently here; maybe that's why Asian elders were consistently assaulted during the pandemic; maybe that's why my family was constantly threatened, mocked, and harassed by our neighbors growing up; maybe that's why I was followed by a van for hours when I was 16 while the driver drove past me telling me how much he loved asian girls until my parents found me cowered crying in the Kmart shoe section. This mindset isn't central to any race; it's a societal issue that leads to people (of all backgrounds, all races, and all shapes and sizes) believing that we're weak cowards who'll take anything with our heads down. It hurts like hell and it hurts even more for someone to insinuate it's our faults because we didn't look or dress the right way because I'm here this year on nearly full financial aid, and even if I wasn't, it shouldn't be happening. The Asian community, and especially the Chinese international community, is hurting. That hurt is real and that hurt is valid.

But there are two communities here hurting- two communities that have been pitted against one another since they started coexisting. Pain and anger and grief make people irrational, but that irrationality shouldn't have implications on how we view an already discriminated and disenfranchised community and race. I've seen members of my own community make this a race issue when being a heartless murderer has nothing to do with race. I will never defend the acts of any individual who does things with the intentions of harming anyone- we could extrapolate and claim it was desperation, and we can say that they were the product of their surroundings, all of which is 100% true, but take it from me that returning home after nearly being hit by a train because of my race and being slapped with ""don't blame the individual, it's not their fault, they only did what their circumstances allowed them to"" is one of the most invalidating feelings you could face.

But there's a difference between demanding accountability for the individual involved and insinuating that this is the fault of an entire race of people and an entire community. Don't we know how it feels to be blamed for something we took no part in condoning, especially after this pandemic? Don't we understand how it feels to be hit with a label because of the color of our skin? Are there some truly evil individuals out here? Of course. But remember that when I was nearly pushed into an oncoming train, it was the locals who intervened, made sure I was okay, and gave me their spare masks. Whether you like it or not, this city is our home for however long we decide to stay here for. We have a right to live in peace and safety without fear of discrimination, but so do the communities who've called this place home for longer than we have.

I can't give a proclamation of what actions we should take to make sure this doesn't happen again. Reconciling with our neighboring communities, community outreach, and redistribution of wealth are all important long-term solutions, but as a secret said, these will take years. Is expanded policing the best short-term solution? Probably not, but I admit I am nowhere near well-read enough to make any claims on that end. But something that I know would help is if all of you had a little more fucking empathy for those who disagree with you. We don't know what the other's gone through; we don't know what they're feeling, and chances are, we never will. I know this language flowery and pretentious and the epitome of why UChicago kids suck, but I'm tired of the hypocrisy going on here and I'm tired of people hearing but not listening.

TLDR: this is such a shitty situation for everyone so have some fucking empathy, even for those you don't agree with"
"Student safety, as far as I am concerned, means a marked reduction in violent crime. I think there’s an incredibly valid argument to say that it is unacceptable that anybody would be shot in Hyde Park, or indeed anywhere else. However, the university bears a great deal of responsibility over the health and safety of its students as they are engaged in study here, so it should be concerned especially with its students.

To say that a murder within sight of campus is simply part of living in a big city is ridiculous. This shouldn’t be business as usual, and it isn’t business as usual. I don’t understand why people are trying to say that students signed up for the possibility of being shot simply by attending this school. Living in a big city, and especially attending a university in a big city does not mean you accept armed robbery and targeted assault."
"To add to this, aren’t many members of UCPD also residents of the area? The organization is not perfect, sure, but why are all these college liberals who’ve never spoken to community members asserting that the whole community hates UCPD…even though UCPD is largely made up of members of the community they are patrolling?"

"Stop bench pressing with clips on please. I only ever see beginners doing this so I assume you guys just don’t know, but it’s actually less safer to do so and takes away clips from people doing exercises that do need them."
this school and it’s student body are so violently and blatantly anti-asian I’m genuinely disgusted.
"The rally was hijacked by a bunch of white thinker guys who made it seem like a pro cop event when it was organized by Asian (esp Chinese students) wanting accountability. News coverage highlighted white speakers too for some reason

Not saying that there isn’t racist rhetoric from the attendees but the intent wasn’t pro ucpd at all"
"does anyone ever like REALLY need to see their therapist and they have an appointment later in the week (which is good) but they literally feel so bad like two days before that they need to talk to someone immediately but it’s not exactly urgent because they don’t wanna k*ll themselves or anything??? so they just sit there waiting impatiently???

just me?? okay 😁🥲"
Post your opinion on your public profile. Do it.
I know y’all. Gettin lost trying to walk from 57th to 53rd. Honestly surprised more people aren’t mugged. We don’t need more cops just so u can walk around listening to ambient music pretending you’re in a movie.

Is staying alive a privilege that the three uchicago students shot this year cannot enjoy?
"That University of Austin grifter thing is an obvious Mossad honeypot, right? Pretty embarrassing Zimmer got caught up in it."
"Why would anyone expect corrupt and incompetent Chicago, Cook County and Illinois politicians to change and improve Hyde Park when hacks like David Axelrod invite them to the College and bootlick them and tell them how amazing they are? The University fat cats are COMPLICIT. They don't give a shit either."
"For those of you think
1. Stat professors sign the letter because they lost a talented student is wrong
2. Faculty members call for more safety measures is sinister
3. The perpetrator is the real victim
4. Getting shot is a norm in large cities and it's the victim who is unlucky and not careful enough
5. International students/asians are rich, robbing and killing them is not my matter.
6. If you feel unsafe and scary at Hyde Park, you can transfer out (same as if you don't like America, you can just leave. etc.)

I feel ashamed and disgusted of being at the same school with you."
"tfw you realize the University is just a racket for administrators to become millionaires. They don't care about us, they don't care about the future of the College, they don't care about crime, they don't care about the city of Chicago. The University exists to make these self-serving freeloaders a boatload of money until they can job hop or retire, period. Zim was making millions as president and there are hundreds of mid and high level ""administrators"" making $200k $400k $500k+ a year"

Imagine being in a room full of university admins last weekend and some overpaid boomer has the bright idea to strong-arm control the college's reddit page because THAT is the key to controlling the narrative and keeping apps and yield high. lol embarrassing schmendricks

"Fuck this country and its love for guns. How do people see homicides on a daily/weekly basis and still advocate for guns? Can someone find a legal loophole to make every gun lobbyist fear for their life, like maybe recruiting random people to carry guns around the neighborhoods that these people live in.

I didn't even know the guy at all but just the fact it happened to a student right on campus is so unsettling for me. Do gun lobbyists never experience gun violence, or are they just devoid of all emootion/sense?"
the uchicago urge to believe you are qualified to have an expert opinion on any topic just by virtue of going here 🥰 the aggresively pro-cop mfers in the chat absolutely seething at the idea that published experts and data might have a better grasp on the situation at hand than their personal feelings about it

Wondering how many stem profs who signed that letter crying about how unsafe they felt were the same ones who tried to give students as little slack as possible in June 2020 — almost like their outrage is fake and they only care when their demographic is affected
"Hyde park is clearly a safer neighborhood with more jobs and opportunities bc of UChicago. UCPD employs people from the Chicago area and makes a large area around Hyde park generally safer. There are a lot of problems with policing, but the UCPD is safer than the CPD; the UCPD can always be reformed, but we definitely need their presence now more than ever."
what is this the fucking chamber of secrets? jeez
Bruh why r we so concerned about crime. wld rather get shot than take my lin alg final

Anyone living in a North apartment with a vacancy that would potentially be interested in pulling someone in? Will pay $ if necessary.
"Gun crimes would basically end overnight if Chicago adopted stop and frisk like NYC had from the 1990s to 2013. If UCPD and CPD want to pat me down once in a while so be it if we're all safe and nobody else is mugged or shot moving forward.

Y’all at that protest really had stuff that said “student lives matter” Omg
"Every year, CPD manages to make arrests in less than 30% of homicide cases and somehow does even worse on other crimes. It is impossible for a department this bad at its job to be an effective deterrent without permanently stationing a cop on literally every single street, which would get people killed, and would be several times more expensive than actually addressing the root causes of crime.

People are justified in being afraid for their safety right now, but this situation is really separating those who actually want to make things better from those who want to enact some sick revenge fantasy against black people."

"randos at the protest: “there’s so much violence in hyde park meaning we need to expand the ucpd!! that’ll fix our problems!!”

i’m confused on how growing ucpd, already one of the largest private police forces in the world, will help the issue if they’ve already done little to help the community? their size should’ve already been enough but yet here we are still dealing with the issue. it’s almost like you people aren’t looking for real solutions and are actively looking for more ways to hurt the black community of south chicago. did summer 2020 not show you anything? that there’s patterns? or do you only care when it isn’t about black people? huh??"

"How is it “violently anti-black” when all we ask for is to not get robbed and shot at??! Some of y’all throw “racist” and “anti-black” at everyone and everything that doesn’t align 100% with your viewpoint. Everyone agrees that there need to be social programs to fix the root of the problem in the long-term. The only point of dispute is what to do short-term when there can’t be a major change in crime waves. And proposing having more UCPD is somehow racist and anti-black?? They aren’t the official police, first of all. And they shot in the shoulder of ONE person who was running at an officer with a metal bar after talking to that person for 2 minutes. And some of y’all act like all they do is harass and shoot at people. Please show how UCPD has a pattern of violence outside of the workings inside your heads."
"I totally empathize with all of you but am I like the only one honestly not fearful of crime at all? Then again, I've never used my U-Pass and I don't really shop in Hyde Park."

I wish I knew whether you actually wanted to get with me LOL I want to shoot my shot ):

"You need to take economics of crime with levitt, youll realize how stupid you sound right now."
"A couple of points:
- I know UCPD can't solve the overall crime and poverty issue but at least it can to some degree stop more students from dying, which is the problem we are trying to tackle now. When we find a good solution to crimes that doesn't marginalize people (which neither side of the political isle currently has), we can phase policing out. A temporary solution is always better than letting things fester, especially when the problem is something as lethal as gun violence.
- I assume we all came here knowing that there is a non-zero probability (and one higher than most places in the US) where we get involved in violent crime during our stay here but three murders around me in a single year is still too much and demands attention and action from those with power.
- Shame on the people who are victim blaming and saying ""he should've known better and not walked around in Canada Goose and a headphone."" The murderer/criminal is always the one who's wrong by definition unless you think killing someone isn't wrong. Also, Dennis came from a single-parent family and his mom is a retired nurse from a third-tier city in China. His family went into a lotta debt to put him through college in HK and the master's program here. I've read stuff his friends wrote about him and he was a frugal and careful person who probably wouldn't waste money on Canada Goose so stop racial profiling any Asian kid as rich ass spoiled bastards and stop sympathizing with the murderer simply because he's a black kid from an impoverished part of the city.
- ""No one is forcing you to be here"" lol sounds like something a Karen would say just saying
- Stop being liberal for the sake of being liberal. EMPATHY is more important than political agenda
- You can't just dismiss crime and murder as ""a part of city life"" and attack and ridicule people who are scared of them because A. in general people don't want to get murdered and B. there are world-class cities where you don't have to worry about getting robbed or murdered on the daily. In fact, there are metropolitan cities where you can pass out on the streets at 2 AM and still find your wallet on you the next morning - I lived in one. Living in a neighborhood where you have to worry about getting shot every day is not something people can take pride in, at least I can't see non-natives taking pride in that."
"95% of you are privileged rich children who’ve never struggled in life, and the city hates you for it.

You aren’t part of the chicago community, or any urban community. This isn’t your city, stop acting like it is. You’re probably afraid to even talk with someone who lives here. No one needs to hear your pretentious ass opinions.

Please stop talking."
not a beginners thing stfu.
"i feel like the white saviors don’t understand that abolition is a long term solution. we need extremely strong social safety nets before we can begin to deconstruct the concept of having police officers. of course blindly funding UCPD isn’t a good short term solution either, especially to prevent off campus crime, but we need to focus more on how the education system, the DCFS, healthcare, etc. is absolutely failing young children in the south side. rarely do i see white saviors actually volunteering their time and labor toward helping these poor children, which is probably the most effective thing they can do to work toward long term abolition."
"I think at some deep level what we’re witnessing is the crumbling of enlightenment liberal democracy and we’re seeing what the breaking point of that epistemology and way of being in the world amidst so many interlocking crises. (And mind you, a better framework can emerge.) It’s much easier to understand that breakdown from an analytical/academic perspective, but when it really starts to happen… everything feels like a spiral"
"""don't wear a Goose or AirPod Pros off campus if you don't want to be robbed/shot"" is literally no different than telling female students not to wear skirts if they don't want to be raped. STOP VICTIM BLAMING!"
What are the anti-cop short term solutions for safety?
I don’t think many of you understand how classist your critiques of “defund the police” actually are… the elite privilege bubble really clouds your vision
"To all the lefty kids on campus:

You do realize that increase policing is correlated with increased crime, right? Like you, I want to ensure that university students don’t go unpunished for their capital offense of attending an institution that has made Hyde Park safer than any of its neighbors, and to make sure UChicago doesn’t lose the quirky charm of making its students play Russian roulette any time they walk to class. But the way to do this is increasing police presence! To my brothers in arms at CNC, to my comrades spray-painting “fuck off” in Chinese outside of our Provost’s house: the solution has been staring us in the face the entire time! Throw down your signs, and start agitating for increased police presence to punish UChicago for its crimes."
"Militarize UCPD. Come on, the Illinois National Guard Armory is on 53rd and Cottage grove. Can’t we just have some tanks posted up on the corners of the university?"
"This really isn't the brilliant, ""street smart"" take you clearly think it is.
You should be able to walk around at 2pm without getting shot at...it's not sheltered to want that very normal thing to be true."
"Lol what a dumb take, just bc polsky didn't accept your startup doesn't mean it's a center of anti-blackness"
"If you want a serious answer, a big part of it is that (1) Chicago already has among the strictest gun laws in the country, and (2) most illegal guns in Chicago come from outside Illinois. There's not much more we can do in the realm of gun laws in terms of Chicago politics, and not much more period beyond getting other states to strengthen their gun laws which isn't going to happen (at least, not for the sake of the city) since most red states hate Chicago anyway, and guns have unfortunately become a cultural issue in the US."
"The defund malcontents expose how painfully dim they are repeating their disinformation talking point: ""one of the largest private police forces in the world."" Not only not anywhere close to being true, the University spends less than $15 million annually on public safety, which is peanuts."
Weights sliding during bench press is an issue of either poor form or doing a weight that is too heavy for you to do properly. In either case it is better to reduce the weight than to use the clips and reinforce these bad habits.
"The University's strategy to get past this violent crime crisis: i.) ban all moms, dads, and prospies from posting crime concerns on reddit. ii.) emphasize Dennis was no longer enrolled. iii.) do not send security alerts when undergrads are robbed at gunpoint next to South."
"Would the GPA doesn't matter kids please share your internship and full-time offers? All of my fourth year sorority sisters with 3.8s to 4.0s—who aren't going to law or medical school—have prestigious 100,000$ job offers after making about 20,000$ interning last summer. The few rando fourth years I know with low 3.0s aren't getting offers for even half that, if they even have offers."

"My corp fin (yes it's the notorious corporation finance) prof who signed the letter has always been a super nice and lenient professor. In fact, he is prob one of the few professors that replaced the mandatory inperson class with BOTH inperson class AND online videos right after Tuesday's incidents. He also sent out a heartwarming email comforting students.
Meanwhile my civ professor did nothing. Nothing."
"I peaked in high school. The responsibilities of life are steadily encroaching upon me and I am running out of things to look forward to. My time in college is already half over, and I am not suited to the real world. I have no interest in drugs, romance, or starting a family. The disadvantages of growing up obscure any advantages people keep telling me there are. Living in an apartment (with friends) feels completely isolating. I have never felt as free as I once was in high school. In high school, it was good enough to get into a college where I could pursue what I was good at, but I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing now."

"Yes I understand the feeling that students on campus have about the risk of being shot or mugged but with an increase in police activity could we look at the way it will affect non white and non Asian students- I.e students of color ( black, Latino, Hispanic, darker skinned people from all ethnicities) who are afraid of police because of the risk of being profiled? Not only do we have to prove ourselves worthy of being listened to in our classes we will also have to prepare to be questioned outside of our classes about our presence in this academic space by police who will see our skin color and make assumptions about our intentions on campus. It’s already a lot of mental drain on us to tiptoe around international students, white students, and Asian students who see a dark skinned person and automatically assume the worst. We don’t want to have to bring this up but who will listen to us when we say this out loud? Just my thoughts but I want to see what others have to say about this point."

"I am not personified. I am a set of shattered building blocks that were enslaved and coerced to conjoin by me. I am a broken individual with no concept or frame of what it truly means to be broken, casting self-induced skepticism on my own diagnosis of my condition and self-worth. I am self-antagonizing, death-willing, hope-defeating. The culmination of my life is the present, but my present all but diminishes my passion for life, my happiness, and my dreams for the future. I illude others with energy and excitement — a genuine action. I am dejected by the smallest of missteps, and dangle by the edges of a string tugging a rope. Pierced by the most delicate of perceived errors, I live on the brink of existence as I fail to understand why I care about things so unimportant. I am manipulated by my own perverse assumptions of success — a dreaded materialism that intoxicates my ego — and fail to navigate the maze of my thoughts. I just want to be free.

If you dislike UCPD, then maybe YOU should be the one transferring to a different school. I hate to break it to you, but the UCPD is here to stay—the university has no plans to abolish or even reduce the size of the UCPD.

I bet you don’t even realize how dumb your own logic is."
"lol. The uppity trustfunders have commandeered this page. ""We call on the UCPD to insulate us in a snow globe because daddy can't!"" lest we forget you were screeching about muh police brutality like a few months ago. it's hilarious how fickle and fake you are. God help you in the real world"

"Damn just got accepted to Pritzker School of Medicine here but ain't no way I'm staying in this shit hole, wow wow how times can change so fast. School really went from a top 3 choice for me to just zero chance of attending. Would rather go to the caribb tbh."
"LMAO the ""WE DEMAND HEALING NOW"" signed by mostly undergrads and ""A call for action to enhance the safety and security of our community"" signed by mostly faculty LOOOOL"
Is an undertone the same as an overtone?
"Despite making up 9.1 percentage of the population of South Africa, white people take up 100 percent of the apartheid"
More policing does not increase crime lol. Who would even believe that. More people become more violent and use drugs more because there’s more police?? Wow.
Is it just me? I sometimes feel unsafe even from these radical peer students at the same school.
"As a follow-up to the secret about weights sliding around, you're right. When I tried benching without clips the first time, they did slide around, but that was a long time ago, so in my last workout I tried it without the clips and they didn't slide around. It was nice too, since as I was getting close to failure I didn't have to move the pins up like I normally would for amrap sets. Anyway I just want you to know that I've changed my mind and will be benching sans clips from now on."
"If you hate UCPD so much. Why don’t you move to places with no UCPD presence, like Englewood."
Fuck the “justice” system
"Can we stop with the state school slander on poll party lol, like people who go to state schools aren’t fucking stupid and it’s not like a playground where nothing is difficult. Stop with the humble brag that just because you go to UChicago you’re automatically a harder worker or smarter person than someone at a state school, many of which probably could get into a place like UChicago but maybe couldn’t afford it. If you have to constantly remind yourself how smart you are and how much better off you are than someone at a state school, maybe you’re here for the wrong reasons"
"I’m tired of the crime debate. It’s getting cold again, may I suggest Canada goose debate?

"What if we get rid of ucpd and have cpd instead? Oh I know because they UChicago kids would also be held responsible for when they break laws such as underaged drinking and drug possession! Bc let’s be honest that is the real function of ucpd, to let uni kids get out of trouble bc the school cares more about its reputation than about keeping people alive. Bc I think we all know cpd would do a better job deterring crime."
If you’ve had 3 dieses you shouldn’t have to wear a mask
"@ that one secret, my gpa is low (failed a class once) and getting lower (about to fail another) and i just got an internship a few weeks ago for big tech (faang). lol YOULL be fine"
any parties to go to if we are staying for thanksgiving break?
"Militarize UCPD and also the Hyde Park community. I'm talking tanks, artillery, nerve gas, and other horrors. This way, UCPD will not shoot community members because the ensuing unrest would impose unacceptable human costs on UCPD, while the community will not commit murders or muggings because UCPD can inflict similar costs. Because police and communities form a bipolar system, the resulting balance of power should be stable and not break down."
and care not cops is STILL preaching to defund the police???
y r u friending me? I don't know you. I feel like I wouldn't like you. cease
I’m so glad that the administration gives zero fucks about what CNC and supporters say

Are you actually saying that brown South Asian students are not POC what
"Letter from students (0% study criminology, policing, or incarceration because we don't have that here; most don't even have a social science/law/etc. field they have extensive knowledge of), mostly guests at hp: omg yes
Letter from faculties, a larger percentage of which are actually hp residents: fricking no they don't even study incarceration so their knowledge in other related fields is bs
Your illogical ass just wanna stay in your own utopian bubble and it shows."
"Kyle Rittenhouse aquitted on all charges?

We are fucked."
Are there any good suit-fitting places downtown?
the girl on the 2nd floor of reg today ATTENDING OFFICE HOURS and talking loudly for 30 minutes straight. are you for real?
LOL the Cnc petition is so so embarrassing. Not a single person in that organization has common sense. Such a vocal minority.
"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like no one who signed the cnc letter (as of the time I'm writing this) actually studies criminology, policing, or incarceration? They are just students who haven't even earned their degrees yet, and we don't even know the academic background of the neighbors. I looked through those and I couldn't really find anything about what the students and neighbors studied. Maybe they just haven't published their papers yet. I just find it a little concerning that a lot of students (and maybe some admin) seem to be swayed by the sheer volume of people who signed the letter. Obviously students can and should make their opinions known, and it's possible for people to be knowledgeable about safety issues outside of the focus of their research. It just seems like the people we should be looking to in these situations are those who have dedicated their careers to studying crime and ucpd's influence on Hyde Park and southside. And if those people haven't backed the cnc letter - in fact, I don't think anyone has dedicated their careers to this specific area - then maybe students should be more skeptical of its content? (Again, this wasn't a comprehensive research, so correct me if I'm wrong. I just saw the letter and was struck by the extreme measures recommended with less than 10 general faculty members.)"
Kyle Rittenhouse is daddy. UwU
The woodlawn bagpiper is completely justified and should be allowed to play on a Friday before quiet hours.

"I personally believe Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty. That being said, that does not mean I agree that he has done the right thing. People should direct their anger towards the *law*, not the *justice system*. I don't think the judge and the jury have done the wrong thing. I think anger should be directed at lawmakers who have built laws that allowed Rittenhouse to be not guilty."
"Want to humble yourself? Go to the nearest mirror, and notice your ears. Just look at them."
i couldn’t give fewer shits. buttercup by jack stauber is a dank fucking song
where can I read the alternative letter responding to the one with 300 faculty signatures?
"So why is ""All Lives Matter"" racist? Seems more egalitarian than ""Black"" or ""Asian"" lives only. Aren't you choosing to be offended by deeming it a denouncement?"
How do I find decent guys at frats who don’t just want to fuck you. Want to have fun but don’t want to keep meeting douches.
"They attention-craving ""activists"" are just bitter and jealous of their smarter, wealthier, and more attractive classmates. Imagine being happy to see classmates stolen from, harassed, robbed, and shot. These kids are ugly inside and out."
I guess I'd say GPA is irrelevant too if I was an urm and quickly realized I'm the dimmest in all of my classes and had no way of earning a 3.75 to 4.0 GPA. It's a defense mechanism; a cope.
"GPA doesn't matter if you want to make $35,000 a year in your hometown after graduation and work with degree mill colleagues. But for those of us with ambition, it is incredibly important, obviously."
David Axelrod hasn't tweeted once about the crime around campus or held any politicians accountable for it. Worthless hack.
What is this I hear about students being robbed at gunpoint next to South? Could someone please elaborate on what exactly happened? Was it on Ellis between South and SSA? What time of day?
@dining PLEASE serve jasmine rice more often
"How the Kyle Rittenhouse jury deliberation went down:

Juror #1: Well he did kill those people
Juror #2: But he’s white
Other jurors: Good point."
"Fuck Secrets, fuck UChicago. I can’t wait to get the hell off this campus and back home to my air fryer😍🥰"
this sy looks pretty low to me
they say this is an ugly campus but at least none of you look as inbred as Kyle Rittenhouse
"Yeah, the mask mandate at uchicago doesn’t make a lot of sense. We have some environments with high unmasking for long periods of time (dining halls, student cafes, etc) and others where you have to be masked. We have a high vaccination rate, and boosters now readily available for all professors and undergraduates. At some point, we have to admit that avoiding COVID, under these conditions, with these NPIs (mask mandate, limited hours to some buildings/facilities, no off campus peeps allowed to dorms) isn’t worth it."
Shout out to the guy in Hallowed who switched tables with me when I was looking for an outlet. You're such a sweetheart!
"He will not like me back, I think."
"Short answer is that GPA matters, but the degree to which it matters differs on a lot of factors. High-level banking/consulting/finance jobs that pay six figures out the gate often have a GPA cutoff of 3.7 at least; top law schools also want you to have similarly high GPAs. Your major also has a lot to do with it. I suspect that your fellow sorority sisters with high GPAs going into business majored in econ or something similar, and it is not as difficult to get high GPAs in those fields as it is in, say, MEng or Physics or pre-med. Unfortunately, if you have a 3.0 and you're, say, an econ major, you are probably shut out of most top business/finance jobs for the time being. That isn't to say that you won't find a job, or that you won't find a job that pays decently, but it will be harder, and the pay will almost certainly not be six figures. I have some friends who've graduated in the past few years who majored in econ, pub pol, sociology, law letters, etc. and some of them with mid to low GPAs are working at coffee shops right now (which, to be clear, isn't bad, but I suspect that that's not what the OP is looking for). Conversely, I know people with mid GPAs from my own sorority who are working at middle-tier business/law firms, and some people with high GPAs who aren't making as much as their high GPAs would indicate. It's very case-by-case, and I'm assuming that you're looking for these six-figure kind of opportunities, but it's also important to realize that maybe these people who are saying ""GPA doesn't matter"" are saying that because they don't necessarily want those opportunities that are only available to those with high GPAs (and thus GPA doesn't matter to *them*)."
Can anyone who's taken Yoshida's Economic Policy Analysis before tell me what textbook he uses? I want to get a SERIOUS head start on learning the material before I take it in the spring.
Love OBS making the fact that people are nervous about 3 students getting shot all about themselves lmao
"Something girls know but never talk about:

"Thank you, Care Not Cops, for again embarrassing our university and advocating for the same brain-dead, anti-police nonsense. We are in a dangerous place, and need police on our campus, and a lot of them. If you want to live in a crime infested hell hole with no one to protect you and march around saying how much you hate the university and administration, then please get the fuck out as soon as possible. You’re a bunch of ungrateful hypocrites crying about privilege when you literally go to one of the best schools in the world. The burden isn’t on those of us who don’t want to die at school to leave. It’s on all of you. Fuck off.

And before all of you come at me with your racialized bullshit, I am a poor poc kid who is here on full scholarship. But I also have a functioning brain, unlike you dimwits."
What happens if we order packages to our residence hall that arrive during the Winter break (ie. end of December) when we’re not on campus? Will the residence hall still accept it?
Any of you make friends as a 3rd year? 2nd years not going so hot
Looking at Friendsgiving posts and realizing I’ll never have enough friends to make that happen...
"Political activist groups in college are performative. Let us not anti-agonize each other. If there is an issue you are interested in, you can create or join a discussion group focused on it. We are here to learn. Support non-profits connected to the issue or work in a professional setting to support it if need be."

istg i thought I wrote this. You are not alone at least:)
"W/ regard to the people freaking out about ppl saying gpa doesnt matter.
Im sorry that u have such a shitty personality the only thing that validates you is having a slightly above average gpa."
Fuck you! Y’all were the ones that made it about black people when you posted those racist ass secrets. OBS has every right to respond when people are talking and saying shit like racial profiling is good.
"This is such a dumb fucking take. Three students being murdered is a tragedy, and discussions about safety is important and relevant - but there is a DISGUSTING amount of racist word vomit y’all are using this as an excuse to spew. If you don’t want OBS to get involved, then stop saying racist shit. It’s like claiming Jewish students are “making it all about them” when they discuss how Israel-Palestine discourse doesn’t ever justify antisemitism. Genuinely shut up."
"I'll miss many people at this university when I graduate, but the CNC dumbfucks are not on this list. I hope one day you realize how politics, arrogance, anger, and fake activism are clouding your judgement on the most important issues."

"Still haven’t secured an internship for next summer. 😭 Academics have had me far behind on applying so I’m only starting to get on it now, am I too late to have a good chance of securing a prestigious internship? I have strong prior experience and a high GPA so those areas aren’t a concern. For context, I’m in CS/Math."
I have a huge crush on my art prof and it’s becoming an issue. Like I just zone out looking at him the whole time during class and I can’t focus. He’s just too cute and I can’t stop thinking about him. What do I do? 🥵
